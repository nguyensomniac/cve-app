[{"Full Text": "The Great Divide: Demonstrators on Saturday, April 15, 2017 in downtown Berkeley. Photo: Richard NaglerPolice made 20 arrests and reported at least eleven injured, with seven needing to go to the hospital, at Saturday's so-called Patriots Day rally in downtown Berkeley.\nPro-Trump supporters and white supremacists clashed with members of far-left, self-described anti-fascism factions, including the By Any Means Necessary group and Berkeley AntiFa. The riot closed down parts of downtown, including the BART station, and forced the cancellation of the Saturday farmers market. People were pepper-sprayed and M-80 flash fireworks were thrown into the throng. There were fights and lots of yelling. Many people sought out confrontation and conflict throughout the day, and tensions ran high. At its height, there were hundreds, if not thousands, of people swarming around Civic Center Park and on surrounding streets.\nSee live coverage of Saturday's event as it unfolded. Read about the groups involved and how the city prepared for the April 15 riot.Police confiscated a stun gun, mace, knives, bear spray, an axe handle, pepper spray and a can filled with concrete, among other things.\nIn the midst of the melee, there were some who tried to have constructive conversations. An empathy tent had been set up for that purpose. An artist painted a watercolor of the scene from a safe distance, while one man sat calmly meditating.\n\nIt was the second time in less than two months that people on the right, including self-proclaimed white supremacists, have come to Berkeley to, they say, express their freedom of speech. The first rally, on March 4, also drew opposition groups, and also turned violent. On both occasions, the pro-Trump demonstrators were met by black-clad protesters, their faces hidden by masks and bandanas, who were determined to stop them from gathering.\nHere, a selection of photographs by Berkeleyside staff and contributing photographers Daniel McPartlan, Ted Friedman, David Yee and Pete Rosos.\nPro-Trump, anti-fascist rally in Berkeley on April 15. Most of those from the far left covered their faces. Many on the right wore helmets and masks.

Photo: Daniel McPartlanA rally in Civic Center Park on Saturday, being touted by some critics as perhaps the largest racist event ever seen in Berkeley, has prompted authorities to send a message of caution this week to local residents who plan to attend. And, just before 5 p.m. Friday, the city released a long list of potential weapons it says are banned in the park \"in an effort to ensure the peaceful expression of free speech.\" Those who don't respect the ban could be ticketed or arrested.\nScroll to the bottom of this story to see how to share rally images and footage with Bside.On the list are metal pipes, baseball or softball bats, lengths of lumber or wood, wooden dowels, poles, bricks, rocks, glass bottles, pepper spray (OC spray), mace, knives or daggers, shields, axes, axe handles or hatchets, ice picks, razor blades, Tasers, eggs and \"any other item that is generally considered an 'implement of riot' that can be used as a weapon.\" It's the first time, at least in recent memory, the city has announced special rules like this before a protest event.\nIn addition, \"Signs and flags ... must be held by hand, and may not be affixed to any pole or stick,\" the city said. City spokesman Matthai Chakko said staff can impose these rules because the rallies are planned on public land, and because no one has applied for permits for them. A \"Patriots Day\" demonstration and \"Antifa\" counter-protest are expected to draw hundreds to Civic Center Park to rally for \"free speech,\" on the one side, and against fascism on the other. On March 4, the two groups clashed, leading to arrests and injuries.\nChakko said nearly all the items on the banned list are ones that came into play March 4. The city has declined to say much about what preparations it has taken to ensure that it's ready for Saturday, but officials say they are. Chakko told Berkeleyside on Friday that the city's main message to community members is about how to stay safe.\n\nThe city is advising peaceful protesters, as well as those who are documenting events, to separate themselves from any violence they see Saturday to avoid getting hurt and to allow police to intervene more efficiently. Said Chakko, \"The people on March 4 came armed and they came armored. If you see people armed and armored, and you want to stay safe, separate yourself.\"\nHe also cautioned anyone planning to come demonstrate to watch out for propaganda.\n\"It's really important for people ... to not get baited, to not get provoked into coming or responding based on what they might be hearing through rumors or social media or people they don't know,\" he said. \"The motives behind why they want people to come may not be why a peaceful protester needs to come.\"\nNo permits have been sought from the city by anyone planning to rally in Berkeley on Saturday, and Chakko said that is noteworthy.\n\"It's something the public should be aware of when they're evaluating an event,\" he said. \"Part of what permits do is indicate the focus ... or interest in lawfulness of the organizers.\"\nChakko said there will be \"a lot of officers on the ground\" Saturday, who will work to arrest any lawbreakers they see. But he said officers will take overall public safety into account as well. Should the immediate situation not allow for arrests, he said, police will pursue leads and investigations until arrests can be made. Following the March 4 protests, police twice asked for the public's help to identify people they said broke laws that day. Ten people were arrested March 4, and investigators pursued other arrest warrants later.\nChakko said the city will use Nixle and Twitter to put out updates to the community as Saturday unfolds.\n\"The goal of the Berkeley Police Department is to facilitate free speech for this event and make sure people are safe, in line with the community's values,\" he said. \"That's a challenge. And that's something that Berkeley police do quite skillfully.\"\nChakko noted that the March 4 rally was contained to Civic Center Park and did not result in any injuries or property damage outside the park. He said that was an impressive feat because it was a \"significant and substantial event.\"\nBusinesses in downtown Berkeley have taken various approaches to the planned rally. Wells Fargo bank on Shattuck Avenue, which suffered serious damage during the Feb. 1 Milo demonstration, will install plywood over its windows Saturday, according to a bank employee. The downtown Chase Bank branch, which also suffered damage, plans to close early, at noon, instead of 4 p.m. Starbucks on Center Street, which was looted Feb. 1, will stay open as usual, said an employee.\nThe city of Berkeley has recommended that businesses bring inside any objects that could be used as projectiles, and ensure security cameras are in working order, in case problems do arise.\nChakko said the city, as a matter of standard practice, coordinates with other law enforcement agencies \"for a number of different reasons.\" He and BPD spokesman Sgt. Andrew Frankel declined to say whether Berkeley plans to call in mutual aid from other law enforcement agencies, or has taken any steps tothat end. Frankel said the city has \"resourced appropriately\" in advance of Saturday's event.\nFrankel said BPD has reached out to various organizers for this weekend's events, and Chakko said the city has met with business groups and merchants in preparation for Saturday. No street closures have been announced, but Chakko said the city is going to \"plan for a number of different contingencies.\" The downtown Berkeley farmers market has been canceled by organizers due to the rally in the park.\nThe city has not tallied how much the March 4 protest cost Berkeley, but Chakko said that number could be made available in the future.\nSee the city's tips for staying safe during protests for additional information.Ultimately, he said, the city's main goal for local residents and businesses is safety.\n\"We want to keep as many people safe as possible,\" Chakko said.\nMany local residents have said they are frustrated by the outside attention and wish rightwing activists could find another venue for their events.\n\"I really hope people just ignore them,\" wrote one local resident. \"They deserve no attention!

Photo: Daniel McPartlanThe March 4 rally that featured pro- and anti-Trump protesters ended badly, with people getting hurt and 10 arrests.\nMany fear the demonstration planned for Saturday, April 15, will be worse.\nThe city has banned a long list of items that could be used as weapons, and is urging community members to stay safe Saturday.That's because it is set to feature a number of speakers who will be trumpeting views that diverge greatly from those of many Berkeley residents. Berkeley is a sanctuary city, was one of the first to affirm gay relationships by creating domestic partnerships, voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, and has dozens, if not hundreds, of residents actively working to \"resist\" Trump.\nThe speakers at the rally are those who associate with the \"alt-right,\" or \"alt-light.\" They include Lauren Southern, a Canadian who has belittled transgender people and their fight for equal treatment under the law; Brittany Pettibone, a Gilroy resident who espouses \"traditional values,\" promoted the fake #Pizzagate child abuse ring, and has called for the deportation of \"illegal aliens,\" as well as those holding H1-B visas, because she says they are \"stealing\" American jobs; Vaughn Neville, whose Instagram feed is full of photos of guns, weapons and American flags; and Kyle Chapman, aka \"Based Stickman,\" who was arrested by Berkeley police March 4 on suspicion of felony assault with a deadly weapon, as well as this week after altercations at Civic Center Park.\n\nChapman has termed Saturday's rally \"The Battle for Berkeley,\" and made a video demonstrating how people should dress. He recommends they show up wearing a baseball helmet (which has holes where the ears are, allowing you to hear), motorcycle shinguards, and snowboard goggles (to protect from pepper spray). He suggests they carry a shield and flagpole. He also shows his viewers a spiked ring they can wear, but does not suggest what they can do with it.\n(Some people on the left are also issuing instructions on how to dress. One flyer reads, \"For Safety, Security, and Solidarity; wear a white, gray, or black shirt and jacket (layers is best) and blue jeans. Bring a bandana and something to cover your head.\")\nThe Liberty Revival Alliance, formed by Rich Black, selected to hold a rally in Berkeley because he and others believe the city is not tolerant of differing perspectives, as evidenced by the fact that black bloc and Antifa protesters forced the cancellation of Milo Yiannapolous' speech at Cal on Feb. 1. Coming and talking here is a way to uphold free speech, a fundamental American right, they say. They also play up what they see as the irony that the Free Speech Movement happened in Berkeley.\nBut some on the far left who oppose the alt-right believe free speech only goes so far. Espousing racist and homophobic ideas encourages violence and should be stopped, they say.\n\"April 15 is the next opportunity for the anti-Trump forces to express the power and commitment of our new movement in defense of immigrant rights and against all of Donald Trump's attacks,\" emailed the group By Any Means Necessary, whose members got into various dustups March 4, and have been involved with a number of high profile Berkeley protests marked by violence or extensive property damage. \"Our movement will defend ourselves, our friends, families, neighbors, classmates and coworkers from racist harassment and violence.\"\nEven though traditional liberal ideology holds that people with extreme views should be allowed to speak, the anti-Fascist movement does not, according to Mark Bray, a visiting historian at Dartmouth College and the author of Translating Anarchy: The Anarchism of Occupy Wall Street.\nIts followers believe \"fascist white supremacists should not be granted the right to express their views in public,\" he told Brook Gladstone on WYNC's On the Media. The fascist attitude \"needs to be nipped in the bud ... through a variety of tactics, one of which is through violently disrupting planned clan rallies, neo-Nazi speeches and so forth.... Anti-fascists identify as Communist, as anarchists, as socialists, and want to really organize for a revolutionary rupture.\"\nFear of a more violent rally Saturday led the Ecology Center to cancel Saturday's farmers market, by Civic Center Park, as a precaution. The cancellation means dozens of vendors will lose thousands of dollars.\n\"I understand their fears but at the same time we depend on the farmers market for our income,\" said Carol Sartenaer, co-owner of Phoenix Pastificio in Berkeley. She estimates the closure will cost her $1,200 to $1,400. \"It hurts.\"\nCharles Lantznester, a member of the Oath Keepers, said he will come from Stockton to Berkeley to participate in a \"rally for peaceful, freedom-loving Americans.\" He said he does not know any Trump supporters who are violent and, in fact, thinks the Trump supporters who turned violent March 4 may have been paid agent provocateurs. He expressed hope that Saturday's rally will be peaceful.\n\"All (NON) Trump Supporters to which you refer at any publicized Trump Rally that have become violent, as you also full well know, have been outed as violent individuals paid for by Democrat Party supporters to look like Trump supporters, the likes of which include your Marxist friend George Soros and money that was obtained by the Hillary campaign,\" he wrote in an email to Berkeleyside.\nA fundraising effort on the website wesearchr.com has raised nearly $8,000 from 128 contributors to \"fund the freedom rally\" in Berkeley this weekend. Its goal is $10,550. Black, of the Liberty Revival Alliance, created the fundraiser to pay for expenses related to the event, writing, \"on this day we stand united against censorship. This movement is grassroots and made possible by the people who support our rights to express ourselves.\"\nHe continues, \"This event will happen. We cannot allow ourselves to be bullied and our freedoms to be taken from us. Bring heart, support the Patriots who made their stand on March 4th, again on April 15th.\"\nRead more coverage of the political turmoil in Berkeley since the November election.Black's efforts in Berkeley appear to have given him more clout in the \"patriots\" movement. When he organized his first event in Berkeley, in March, he tried to interest \"Proud Boy\" leader Gavin McInnes. But the two butted heads on Twitter and appeared to be at odds, with McInnes saying he didn't know anything about the March 4 event, would not be there, and did not want his name being used without his permission.\nThis time around, McInnes is promoting Black's plans in Berkeley. Last week, he posted a video online entitled \"Why we're having a Patriots Day rally in Berkeley.\" In the video, he said the anti-fascist movement is over because there are no fascists, and advocated violence against protestors who promote an anti-fascism message.\nStay tuned to Berkeleyside for continuing coverage.\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "Berkeley braces for more protests", "Tags": "['Berkeley Police', 'Berkeley protests', 'By Any Means Necessary', 'Donald Trump', 'Public safety']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Crime & Safety', 'Downtown']", "Natural Language Location": "Civic Center Park", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8693718", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "254446", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.274042", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/04/14/berkeley-braces-another-day-protests/", "Author": "Frances Dinkelspiel", "Date": "2017-04-14T16:09:34-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "A man police have identified as a \"riot suspect\" -- who appears above on the right -- says he did nothing wrong March 4 during rallies for and against Trump that turned violent.

He posted a video on his Facebook page that shows at least part of Monday's confrontation. His video, posted Tuesday shortly before 8:30 p.m., has been viewed more than 144,000 times and shared nearly 2,000 times.\nIn the video, Chapman and several supporters are walking through downtown Berkeley's Civic Center Park already in a shouting match with half a dozen young men who are following him and telling him to leave the area. \"You gonna pull out a knife too?\" one man asks him. \"I don't wanna see y'all around here again,\" says another young man. Chapman exchanges barbs with a man carrying a skateboard as the groups walk slowly through the park. At a certain point, a young man in sunglasses begins screaming and gesturing at Chapman, and challenging him to fight. Chapman turns around, hesitates, and swings at the man, who falls to the ground.

From left to right: Alice Wakida, Lauren Kaneko-Jones, Kimiko Kaneko and Jane Kaneko. Photo: Natalie OrensteinAlice Wakida doesn't remember much from her early childhood at Tule Lake, a Japanese internment camp in Northern California.\nShe recalls a lot of dust. Her cousins, who were kids at the time as well, remember pilfering potatoes from the mess hall and playing hokey-pokey with their friends.\nTheir parents tried to shield them from the atrocities, Wakida said. But as she and her relatives grew up, they became more curious about that dark period of American history and the impact it had on their families. So they were delighted when they found out that family possessions from that era -- two wooden trunks that had held Wakida's father Frank Matsui's belongings at the camp -- had wound up in the hands of the Berkeley Historical Society.\nLast Thursday, several members of the family, whose roots in Berkeley stretch back five generations, visited the Berkeley History Center to see the trunks for the first time. One of the trunks has been on display as part of the \"Berkeley Home Front\" exhibit on the local impact of World Wars I and II, which coincides with the 75th anniversary of the order that forced Japanese Americans to live in internment camps. Until then, Southwest Berkeley had been home to a large Japanese American community of about 1,300 people.\n\n\"If they were lucky and found a caretaker for the home, that was fine. But a lot of them didn't and lost everything,\" said John Aronovici, the manager of the History Center.\nMatsui and his family, along with his sister Kimiko Kaneko and her family, were among a small number who were able to return to Berkeley and settle here once again after the war. Matsui died in 1999 and 99-year-old Kaneko is the oldest living relative.\nWhen her granddaughter Lauren Kaneko-Jones rolled Kimiko, in her wheelchair, up to her brother's trunks on Thursday, Kimiko burst out laughing in recognition.\n\"We had one too,\" she said.\nHer brother \"was very handy,\" and likely built the trunks himself while at the camp, said Kimiko, who speaks quietly but is still a reliable source of family history.\n\nKimiko and Matsui were born in Southern California and grew up on their family's farm in Long Beach. When most of the family moved back to Japan, Matsui, the oldest, stayed behind. In Japan, Kimiko met her husband, another Japanese-American, whose family lived in Berkeley, where the couple eventually moved. They worked together at a laundromat on the corner of Shattuck Avenue and Vine Street. Matsui later moved up here too.\nPresident Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 in 1942, which sent approximately 120,000 people, two-thirds of whom were United States citizens, into the internment camps scattered in desolate areas of the West. Both Kimiko and Matsui's families went to live on their friends' farm in rural Placer County, hoping to escape imprisonment. But they were later sent to Tule Lake, where Kimiko would give birth to her youngest daughter. Matsui and his family were later relocated to the Topaz War Relocation Center camp in Utah. Some family members think he was sent there to tend to the camp's beet farm because he had experience farming. Others wonder if he had given the U.S. government the answer it wanted on the misleading loyalty questionnaire given to all interned adults. Tule Lake had become a \"segregation center\" prison for those who were deemed \"disloyal.\"\nShortly after the war ended, Kimiko, Matsui and their families moved back to Berkeley, first renting a garage on Parker Street, and eventually buying a house on McGee Avenue.

Matsui began working as a gardener.\nMatsui's trunks -- stamped with his name, ID number and \"Central Utah,\" and labeled in ink with the Parker address and inside as \"Tule Lake wood\" -- tell some of this story. But it is a story that some survivors of interment initially tried to forget.\n\"We didn't really talk about it -- a lot of families didn't talk about it until later on,\" Wakida said.\n\nAfter the war, she and her cousins went to Berkeley public schools, which did not teach about the history of Japanese internment until much later.

Shortly before he died last year, he gave a talk on his family's history at the Berkeley Public Library. He also gained some prominence as the subject of a propaganda photograph taken at Tule Lake. The photo, of young Bob grinning in a costume, was among several artifacts from Japanese internment camps put up for auction in 2015 until protesters succeeded in stopping the sale.\nLauren Kaneko-Jones and her grandmother Kimiko Kaneko look at a wooden trunk that a family member made in an internment camp.

Photo: Sonny Abesamis/Creative CommonsTo the relief of hundreds of mourning families, Berkeley Tuolumne Camp will be brought back to life.\nThe City Council voted Tuesday to dedicate $3.3 million to rebuilding the Berkeley-run camp, which was destroyed by the 2013 Rim Fire.\nThat local contribution allows the city to access grants from FEMA. Those federal dollars, along with insurance and funding from the California Office of Emergency Services and insurance money will together cover the estimated $54 million rebuilding cost. Scott Gelfand, who has been leading the campaign to bring the family camp back to life, estimates the insurance funds and FEMA will cover 92% of the rebuilding cost. The city's contribution comes from its Catastrophic Reserve, which was created in January for one-time disaster relief expenses.\n\"We can now move forward to the rebuilding cycle, it's not about the death cycle,\" said Gelfand. The effort to rebuild the camp has been spearheaded by the Friends of Berkeley Tuolumne Camp group which, Gelfand said, is 10,000-strong.\n\nBerkeley Tuolumne Family Camp, a residential summer family camp operated by the City of Berkeley for its residents, is located seven miles west of the entrance to Yosemite National Park.\nWith the financial backing, reconstruction will likely start in 2019, the staff report says, and the popular Yosemite family camp could reopen in the summer of 2021. The site, in operation since 1922, was also used for teen leadership programs and adult camps, until nearly all the buildings were destroyed by the fire.\nGelfand predicts the rest of this year and 2018 will be spent on the design and permitting process.\nThe City Council's vote to rebuild the camp came after several former campers and staff delivered heartfelt eulogies for the institution during a special meeting earlier on Tuesday evening. The camp community has been active in fundraising and campaigning in support of the rebuilding effort. The Friends of Berkeley Tuolumne Camp group pledged Tuesday to make an initial $50,000 donation and continue to raise funds.\nThe city, which operated the camp under a use permit from the U.S. Forest Service, has worked toward rebuilding the site since it burned down. Staff from the city's parks department told the council Tuesday that an initial plan has been drawn up, and \"the city is poised to move forward aggressively.\"\nIn its last summer in operation, Berkeley Tuolumne camp hosted 4,000 campers. Many Berkeley families had spent every summer there for years -- or generations, in some cases.\nAt the meeting Tuolumne alumni listed off all the ways the camp left its mark on their lives -- by inspiring a career in environmental education, or encouraging families to spend more time together. One self-described \"math/tech type\" noted that Tuolumne was the only place where he ever felt inclined to do arts and crafts.\nAnother said he got married there, in the presence of many friends he had met at the camp.\nA photograph taken at the site of the Berkeley Tuolumne Family Camp on Aug. 28, 2013, three days after the Rim Fire swept through it. Photo: U.S. Forest ServiceSome speakers talked about their experience working on staff at Tuolumne, which offered many teenagers their first jobs. They commented on the racial diversity of the staff, saying it exemplified a kind of unity hard to find in the city.\n\"I grew up as a person and saw a lot of people growing up as people,\" said Theo Jerome, who worked at the camp for nine years. \"I think that was the best time of my life.\"\nIt is not only the Tuolumne campers who will benefit from the rebuilt site. The revenue from the camp has historically paid for the bulk of programming at all of the city's other overnight and day camps. After the fire the camps have operated with a structural deficit. Tuolumne brings in the funds for Echo Lake, Cazadero Performing Arts Camp, and Berkeley day camp, which is offered in the summer for kids from low-income families. \"It makes business sense to bring back Tuolumne,\" said Gelfand, \"as it runs at enough of a profit to sustain the other camps.\"\nBerkeley Echo Lake Camp has hosted some family camps since the fire to make up for lost funds.\nThe city's other residential camps are also recuperating from damage, though nothing as extreme as what happened at Tuolumne.\nIn 2016 a landslide at Cazadero left an estimated $1.4 million in damages. Echo Lake also sustained some damage from snow a few years ago. The affected buildings have been repaired, but the camp still needs several hundred thousand dollars in improvement work elsewhere, staff said.\n\"Unfortunately the exposure to nature that we so value in these camps also exposes them to some significant hazards,\" the parks department's Liza McNulty told the council.\nThe allocation of the rebuilding funds passed on the consent calendar. Councilwoman Sophie Hahn said the rebuilding process presented an opportunity for the city to do stronger recruitment for the camps at Berkeley schools.\n\"This is the place where their happiest memories live\"\nGelfand said he was thrilled that the council's action meant the end of the grieving for the much-loved camp, adding that for many, young and old, \"it's very personal -- this is the place where their happiest memories live.\"\nThe Friends group has kept active since the Rim Fire and will continue to be. Forty people recently turned up at the Tuolumne site to join a replanting party. \"We planted 3,000 trees in one day,\" said Gelfand. \"There were kids there and teenagers -- one celebrated her 17th birthday planting trees -- it was magical.\"\nThe Friends group is putting on an event -- the fourth of its kind -- at the Freight & Salvage on May 1 to celebrate the forward motion on rebuilding and to provide updates on what happens next. Gelfand said an oversized check for $50,000, which has already been raised, will be presented to the city, and there will be live music and a short movie.\nAdditional reporting by Tracey Taylor.\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "Berkeley allocates $3.3M to rebuild beloved Tuolumne Camp", "Tags": "['Berkeley City Council', 'Berkeley Echo Lake camp', 'Berkeley Tuolumne Camp', 'Rim Fire']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Community']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley Tuolumne Camp", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8085252", "Zip Code": "95321", "ID": "253784", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-119.9285504", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/04/07/city-council-allocates-3-3m-rebuild-beloved-tuolumne-camp/", "Author": "Natalie Orenstein", "Date": "2017-04-07T13:15:22-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "M.B. Curtis. Photo courtesy Richard Schwartz.Richard Schwartz is a well-known local historian who has written numerous books about Berkeley's characters. Now he may have discovered one of the most colorful people to have ever lived in Berkeley: the world-famous actor M.B. Curtis. After 20 years of research, Schwartz has published The Man Who Lit Lady Liberty: The Extraordinary Rise and Fall of Actor M.B. Curtis, and he will be doing a number of speaking events in the next few weeks. Sign up fast if you want to go on his walking tour of the North Berkeley tract that Curtis commandeered and transformed. Berkeleyside recently caught up with Schwartz to ask about his book:\nWow. M.B. Curtis is quite a character. I had never heard of him, nor did I realize what a significant role he played in building up Berkeley in the 1890s. Can you give readers a brief description of who he was and what he did?\nM. B. Curtis was a Jewish Hungarian immigrant who arrived in the United States at six years old in 1856. His birth name was Moritz Bertrand Strelinger. His family moved to Detroit. He ran away from home in his early teens during the Civil War and tried to enlist in the army as a drummer boy but was rejected due to his extreme youth. He soon became an actor, receiving great reviews in supporting roles. But being a supporting actor meant he was living in flophouses and could barely support himself.\nOne day he was given a comedic role of an awkward immigrant Jewish drummer (a traveling salesman of the day) and he so mesmerized audiences with his comedic characterization that the play ran much longer than scheduled, all due to his portrayal. The play, Sam'l of Posen, shows how an immigrant can be awkwardly dressed and not know the customs to fit in but he can have more to offer the country than some \"established\" Americans.\n\nM.B. Curtis dressed as Samuel for his play, Sam'l of Posen. Photo courtesy Richard Schwartz.Curtis (he had changed his name to a stage name which was more \"American\") was the first Jewish male to be able to portray a Jewish male character on stage. He broke a barrier in place that was imported from Europe and paved the way for the next generations of ethnic actors and comics. Now the audience laughed with him, not at him. The change was a seismic shift.\nSeeing his one chance had arrived, Curtis seized the moment and bought the play. No New York producer would touch the play so Curtis contacted his brother so that they could take the play on the road themselves. By the time they arrived back in New York at the end of their tour, M. B. Curtis had been catapulted to the most popular actor in the country and to wealth and fame.\nThe title of the book is \"The Man Who Lit Lady Liberty.\" Can you explain what that means?\nM. B. Curtis arrived in New York City to perform a new play three days after the Statue of Liberty was dedicated by Frederic Bartholdi, the French designer of the statue, in front of an international audience of hundreds of thousands. But Congress had refused to allocate the funds to continue to light the statue and it went dark on Nov. 7, 1886. Curtis immediately offered to light the statue with his own funds. As an immigrant (and a genius of a publicist) he could not stand to see Lady Liberty in the dark. He became the only citizen in the history of the United States to personally pay for the lighting of the Statue of Liberty -- and he was an immigrant. This is so poignant today with our refocus on immigration.\nHow did you come upon Curtis? How did you do your research, which is impressive. How long did it take you to do the book? Were there any particular challenges?\nI had to write about M. B. Curtis because as I was drawn into his life, it miraculously kept getting bigger and bigger. At first, I only knew of him in Berkeley, where he literally changed the town like no one has before or since. He followed his dreams with passion and because he was catapulted into fame and fortune overnight by his portrayal of an awkward Jewish immigrant in the theatre he had the funds to follow those dreams. The result was a town and nation mesmerized by his every move. The more I studied the man, the broader my view of his life became. I realized his cultural reach went right to the President of the United States and Mark Twain. Even petty criminals took on the alias of \"Sam'l of Posen\" to join the fun. Everyone wanted to jump aboard the charm of his theatrical character. Though Curtis' reach went beyond the theatre, it was always theatrical. The path of his life covered so many experiences- a pioneer in the silent movie industry, a developer, a producer and a suspect in a murder. I had never known of anyone like M. B. Curtis. And no matter how hard things got for him- and they got mighty hard- he always got back up and started following his dreams again. I just had to know what made M. B. Curtis tick.\nHow I started researching his story: It started by reading all the out-of-print history books about Berkeley and learning of Curtis' generosity in paying for Berkeley's new train station, fire house, paving roads, installing street lights and helping many other causes. It expanded to the trajectory of his acting career, his fame, his wife's illness, Curtis' building of the biggest hotel in the West in Berkeley by reading every local newspaper of his day searching for any articles on his activities. That expanded to using newspaper search engines where I found and read thousands of articles on the man and his career. I went to the Statue of Liberty National Monument, The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, and contacted many other institutions trying to corral every tidbit so I could know all there was to know about the man.That expanded to finding his descendants and motion picture repositories, libraries and museums all over the country. The effort took me twenty years and spawned a 1,200-page manuscript and thousands of images, memorabilia and newspaper articles and ads.\nChallenges: The more I researched Curtis, the bigger the story became. The story grew bigger and bigger and more significant as the years went on and he was virtually lost to history. We know of Charlie Chaplin intimately because we can watch his craft in the movies he made. But Curtis was a couple of generations earlier and his work in silent movies was lost. He actually performed in one the earliest movies in 1899. He made a silent movie version of his famous play in 1910 and it was released with another new film of a famous story- The Wizard of Oz- and a poster was made with the two movies in one poster. Curtis then performed with Fatty Arbuckle in one of Fatty's movies- but all this information was lost to the public. It took writing this book to bring Curtis' life into focus.\nWhy do you think Americans became so enamored of Sam'l of Posen?\nHe was an artist of incredible talent and was said to keep audiences in stitches from the time the curtain rose until the final bows. He portrayed the \"modern Jew\" where a Jewish male was allowed to be a full human being with a range of emotions, a love interest, friends, etc. instead of simply a string of negative stereotypical traits. The nation was experiencing its biggest wave of immigration at the time and the play became a way for the country to examine its feelings towards immigrants. Curtis, through comedy, gave them that chance to put themselves in the shoes of a seemingly awkward outsider and see that there was a good human being with something to offer behind the greenhorn's appearance and awkward speech.\nCan you tell readers about the murder charges and the ensuing trial?\nCurtis took his wife to a performance of Camille by the great Sarah Bernhardt in San Francisco with some friends. Curtis, used to being on the other side of the footlights, grew bored and went out for a drink, intending to be back before the play was over. He was mugged on a dark street while trying to return to the theatre. A policeman came along and was shot point blank. Witnesses saw either one man or two fleeing the scene. Curtis was apprehended but the mugger was not. M. B. Curtis, who loved people and socializing, was put in jail and endured three trials that went on for years for the murder of the policeman. His defense used up his fortune and his well-being.\nThe building Curtis built in North Berkeley as Peralta Park Hotel. It was eventually used as a school. Photo courtesy Richard Schwartz.What attracted M.B. and his wife to Berkeley? What were their lofty plans for the city?\nThough there are scores of newspaper articles quoting Curtis as wanting to settle in a city, he and his wife, Albina (Albina Avenue is named after her), were smitten by Berkeley, not only due to its beauty and its convenient location to the theatres, but for its community. The tumbleweed actors wanted to settle down and Berkeley provided that sense of community they so longed for while traveling on the road year after year. Albina had become ill and needed to be near her doctor in San Francisco, and Curtis retired from the stage (which always required traveling) to be with his wife. The Curtises found a community in Berkeley in which to feel they were a part of something and they loved it here.\nWhat remains of Peralta Park? Posen station? Are there other physical reminders of Curtis in existence?\nThe Peralta Park Hotel never opened as a hotel. The expenses and cost overruns of building this extraordinary and dramatic hotel caused Curtis to look for someone to lease it. It became a girls' school, and later was purchased by St. Joseph's and became part of St. Mary's College High School. The hotel building was lovingly referred to as \"The Palace.\" A fire devastated the upper floor in 1946 but the lower floors were still utilized as a dormitory until the building was deemed a seismic hazard and demolished in 1959. The exact location of the hotel is known but none of the structure remains save for some bricks of its foundation held by St. Mary's.\nThe opening of the railroad stop known as Posen Station in West Berkeley. Curtis contributed a significant chunk of money to build the station. Photo courtesy of the Berkeley Firefighters Association.Posen Station was an incredible story as well. To quote from the book, \"But Curtis wasn't only interested in building a place where he could be with his ailing wife and lay his head down in the same place every night. Curtis threw himself into the role of promoter and civic benefactor with all the energy he had brought to his performances on stage. The San Francisco Chronicle noted that Curtis also \"helps in the work of introducing people of refinement and wealth from the East to come and settle in Berkeley\" and that he \"attends the meetings of the West Berkeley Development Association [and] heads subscription lists for local needs.\"\nOne of those local needs was a railway station in West Berkeley. The Southern Pacific Railroad had initially refused to make a stop in that section of town. Some said it was not worth the stop; others said the \"footpads\" in West Berkeley made it too dangerous. \nSchwartz will be holding a public launch party for \"The Man Who Lit Lady Liberty\" on Saturday, April 8 at the North Branch of the Berkeley Public Library from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. Schwartz will do a talk at Pegasus Books, 1855 Solano Ave. at 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday, April 12. He will lead a walking tour of Peralta Park Neighborhood at 1 p.m. on Saturday, April 29.  Call 510-845-6874 for details. See a full listing of Schwartz's events.People in West Berkeley then submitted plans in hopes the Southern Pacific would accept them if the residents offered to pay for the building of the station. By July 1887, the railroad decided to consider a stop at Bancroft Way, along its Third Street tracks. Subscription lists were passed around at the Neihaus Planing Mill and George Schmidt's real estate office to raise funds for the planned station. After raising $950, the boosters were still $250 short of their goal, and Curtis stepped up to the plate, donating the needed balance for construction to begin. In exchange for his help, Curtis got to name the station and, not surprisingly, he named it Posen Station.\nCurtis spoke to the crowd at the station's opening on October 8, 1887, extolling the beauty and modernity of the new building. Photographers then took over to commemorate the event and people were invited into the station for refreshments. Everyone spent the afternoon riding the train from one station to another, getting on and off at Posen Station \"just to see how it felt.\" \nCurtis also agreed to volunteer as president of the Berkeley Light Company, offering to personally pay for the erection and wiring of light poles on Hopkins Street (which bordered his development) and donate them to the electric company. And Curtis helped purchase a bell for the volunteer fire company stationed in the new firehouse in West Berkeley. Through his generosity and civic involvement, Curtis was becoming one of the leading lights of the city incorporated in 1878, which was now beginning to enjoy boom times, thanks in no small part to the man who basked in the reflected glow of Sam'l of Posen.\nCurtis's plan was to establish a colony of theatrical artists in Peralta Park near the home he planned to build on Hopkins Street. Forced to end his touring by his desire to be by Marie's side during her illness, Curtis evidently wanted the theatrical world to travel to him. And to that end, he planned to build a hotel around the corner at what is now the north end of Albina Street (Curtis was still enjoying the pleasure of naming streets after his family, friends, and associates), bringing in a chef from New Orleans and celebrating his new venture by spending $1,000 on a party for his friends--no doubt a dress rehearsal for when he would become a celebrated hotel owner and host. Newspapers as far away as the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported on Curtis's development plans in Berkeley in the fall of 1887 as New York theater people began investing in their fellow actor's dreams.\" ( pages 114, 115).\nCurtis would always want things named after his famous theatrical character, Sam'l of Posen, not himself, so the train station, fire station, sports teams, etc. were all named \"Posen.\"\nWhat was Curtis' life like when he died? Was he still famous? Why do you think he has been forgotten?\nCurtis suffered mightily from the effects of two and a half years of the murder charge, trials and imprisonment. He was never the same after the ordeal. He began to drink heavily and his life and marriage suffered. Times had also changed and the aging couple had to reinvent themselves into managers and producers. It was a long fade for the once-famous actor, save for those who saw him perform and would never forget him.\nWe remember Chaplin and Keaton as we can watch them on film. Though I have found some stills of Curtis' movies, there is no way at this time to actually witness him work, his gossamer magic. Curtis' two iconic and major contributions to American culture- the lighting of the Statue of Liberty and having Mark Twain approach him to perform in and produce a stage version of Twain's book Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, (in which Curtis told Twain he would be happy to produce the play and invest the necessary $20,000 to stage it if Twain would allow Curtis to portray Hank, the main character, as his Jewish immigrant Sam'l of Posen. Twain happily agreed) were forgotten for different reasons.\n\"On February 9, 1941, a note in the Oakland Tribune told of the recent death of Posen A. Johnson. He was the baby who won the $100 prize M. B. Curtis had offered to the first child born in Berkeley named Posen. His father, Rasmus Johnson, and his family had an apartment in the back of Posen Station. The passing of Mr. Johnson marked the end of an era, but nothing will close the book on M. B. Curtis and his Sam'l of Posen. Not now.\" (page 281).\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "Richard Schwartz tells terrific tale of world famous actor who transformed Berkeley", "Tags": "[]", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'Books', 'History']", "Natural Language Location": "Albina Avenue", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8813907", "Zip Code": "94706", "ID": "253713", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2862088", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/04/07/richard-schwartz-tells-terrific-tale-world-famous-actor-transformed-berkeley/", "Author": "Frances Dinkelspiel", "Date": "2017-04-07T07:00:32-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Thousands in Berkeley have lost power, according to PG&E.

Photo: Kai SchreiberOn Tuesday the Berkeley City Council voted unanimously to move ahead with an expansive plan to address homelessness with brand new facilities and services, directing city staff to flesh out the proposal.\nDespite giving the green light, some council members raised concerns about the cost of carrying out the massive plan, saying it could eat up resources that could instead be used for permanent housing or other efforts.\nThe Pathways Project, developed by Mayor Jesse Arreguin and Councilwoman Sophie Hahn, includes both short- and long-term measures. First the city would build two new facilities to provide respite to the most at-risk individuals. The proposal also directs staff to develop a much longer-term plan to end homelessness - likely a regional collaboration with a significant price tag, according to the proposal.\nThe city in recent years has embraced a \"housing-first\" approach to ending homelessness, but given the scarcity of housing in Berkeley, the Pathways Project starts with near-term emergency measures, Arreguin said.\n\nThe first project priority is the creation of the STAIR Center, a new \"low-barrier\" shelter where homeless individuals could live, along with their pets and belongings, for two months. From there, some would move on to the Bridge Living Community, a new \"village\"-like facility, possibly comprised of tent cabins, for up to four more months. There would be access to new and existing services on site at each facility.\nRead Berkeleyside's award-winning coverage of homelessness.To identify potential residents for the new facilities, the city would spend four to six weeks at a homeless encampment, using engagement methods that have been effective at connecting high-needs individuals to services in San Francisco. Once that outreach period was complete and everyone had been offered a spot at the STAIR Center, the city would shut down the encampment.\nAt Tuesday's meeting, Hahn called homelessness in Berkeley \"our homegrown humanitarian refugee crisis.\"\nContinuing to cycle homeless individuals through the medical and criminal justice systems is costly and \"cruel,\" Hahn said. \"We're talking about shifting resources away from expensive and ineffective methods that we have been using for years and years that are essentially the equivalent of banging our heads against the wall.\"\nLast week the City Council heard that some of Berkeley's services are working quite well. Staff reported that 57 people have been housed and hundreds placed in shelters through The Hub, a new \"coordinated entry\" system connecting homeless individuals to an array of city services.\nElements in the Pathways Project would interact with and fortify these existing programs and services, Arreguin said. The Hub would help refer people to the STAIR Center and perform intakes there, he said.\nRendering of the STAIR Center. The design could change significantly. Photo: Chris Walker/screen shot from proposalWengraf: \"Does this threaten our ultimate goal of building permanent affordable housing?\"\nThe Pathways Project proposal is scant on details -- no funding sources or locations for the two new facilities are named -- which some council members noted.\n\"This is not a deal-breaker for me, but I think it's really important to identify the funding first,\" Councilwoman Lori Droste said.\nIt is the job of city staff to hash out the specifics, said Arreguin and Hahn. Tuesday's vote sends the proposal to the Ad Hoc Sub-Committee on Homelessness (comprised of Arreguin, Hahn, and Councilmembers Linda Maio and Cheryl Davila), which will come back to the council with recommendations on implementing the plan, including potential costs and funding sources. City staff will also begin developing the long-term initiative. The proposal says that plan should come back to the council by the end of 2017, but City Manager Dee Williams-Ridley said that timeline is unrealistic.\nCouncilmembers Wengraf and Droste said they worry the Pathways Project could backfire somewhat, inadvertently halting efforts to house homeless individuals by devoting dollars and attention to the interim short-term measures.\n\"Does this in any way threaten our ultimate goal of building permanent affordable housing for all those people?\" Wengraf asked.\nThe City Council voted Tuesday, April 4 to pursue the Pathway Project. Photo: Natalie OrensteinAdvocates of the Pathways Project did not deny that implementation would require a major fundraising effort and innovative financing.\nThe City of Berkeley spends $17.7 million in federal, state and local funds on homeless services and related police and medical costs. The city allocates $3.8 to community agencies providing services for the homeless. Building and operating the STAIR Center alone could cost more than that, said Droste, pointing to the cost of San Francisco's Navigation Centers, which were the model for Berkeley's proposal.\n\"I am committed to exhausting all other avenues of resources -- federal dollars, state, county and private philanthropic dollars,\" Hahn said. \"If this gets passed tonight, I will start doing outreach tomorrow, looking at foundations and wealthy individuals in Berkeley and beyond.\"\nMaio: There's nothing wrong with being \"ambitious\"\nDuring public comment, many people cautiously praised the plan. Berkeley Considers, the city's new online commenting platform, also brought in 50 responses, a little more than half supporting the plan.\nBoona cheema, the former director of Building Opportunities for Self-Sufficiency and a longtime advocate for the homeless, called the proposal \"incredible\" but said she was eager to help improve it. She calculated that she's spoken over the years with more than 10,000 homeless individuals, who want a level of security and respect this proposal does not provide, she said.\nA homeless man said he is skeptical that short-term facilities can provide adequate support for people with mental-health needs.\n\"I have clinical depression and that's why I'm concerned about this program,\" he said during public comment. If a homeless person stops taking their medication, \"it takes weeks and sometimes months for people to get back to normality...The best thing for these people is actually being in a permanent place where they can take their medicines,\" he said.\nCouncilwoman Kate Harrison agreed that the plan could let some people fall through the cracks, like those who have long lived in shelters and will miss out on the chance to stay at the new facilities. Others asked about the people living in encampments who do not comply with the city's outreach.\nMaio, who noted that her West Berkeley district is \"ground zero for encampments,\" said she is hopeful the proposal, which she cosponsored, could provide an alternative for most.\n\"We are very ambitious.

Photo: Emilie RagusoDescribed as a \"homegrown leader\" with a deep grasp of Berkeley values, \"native son\" Andrew Greenwood was appointed by the City Council to the role of police chief Tuesday night.\n\"Without a doubt, I'm bringing you ... the best there is for the city of Berkeley,\" City Manager Dee Williams-Ridley told council. \"I could not ask for a better individual to sit beside to lead.\"\nGreenwood said building community trust will be his primary focus. He has already planned a series of events coming up this year to hear concerns and priorities from all sectors of town. He is collaborating with the Police Review Commission (PRC) on an ordinance to limit government surveillance, and is getting closer to equipping officers with body-worn cameras. On May 24, he said, the PRC will hold a much-anticipated public meeting to take an in-depth look at police stop data released in 2015 that department critics said showed racial bias. And Greenwood pledged to continue to work closely with the PRC going forward.\nGreenwood, who moved up through the ranks to a captain spot over his three decades at BPD, has been interim chief since September, when former Chief Michael Meehan abruptly resigned. Greenwood was born and raised in Berkeley. His parents still live in the home he grew up in, and his sister and her family live in town, too. He attended Jefferson, Franklin and King schools, and graduated from Berkeley High. He and his wife still live in Berkeley, and their sons have attended Berkeley public schools too.\n\nPolice Chief Andrew Greenwood received the permanent appointment Tuesday night. Photo: Emilie Raguso\"My life in Berkeley informs my work in the Berkeley Police Department, throughout the many roles through my career,\" he told council. \"As chief, I think I bring a uniquely local perspective to formulating strategy, policies, and engaging with our community. I am mindful of the broad range of diverse views and interests of our community, and firmly rooted in principled, constitutional policing while being cognizant of the issues and challenges facing the men and women of our department on a day-to-day basis, while they work to keep our community safe.\"\nGreenwood said he's already hired 10 new officers, and promoted nine people, since he took the helm. He's overseen large-scale community protests that drew national scrutiny. The department has been putting out more information through Nixle alerts, and recently went live on Twitter, after years of promising to do so. (Follow Chief Greenwood on Twitter, as well as the general department account.) He's relaunched \"coffee with the cops\" events where community members can have informal chats with the chief and other department staff.\nGreenwood said the department is also working to update its use of force policy to bring it in line with modern standards. For context, he said, BPD had 78,700 calls for service in 2016, made 3,200 arrests and issued 5,600 citations. Police recorded 32 uses of force last year, which prompted eight complaints.\n\"Eight complaints out of 3,200 arrests is about one complaint in every 400 arrests,\" Greenwood told council. \"That's about a quarter of 1%.\"\nHe said that doesn't mean the department doesn't need to update its policy, however, and promised to report back to council in September with news on that effort. And that's not all. Greenwood said he'll launch a new annual report on use of force to increase transparency on BPD data. Those numbers have not previously been readily available except in the somewhat obscure annual Police Review Commission report.\nAndrew Greenwood, then a police captain, at a department promotion ceremony in 2013. Photo: Emilie RagusoA handful of community members, including the local branch of the ACLU, said there should have been a broader search and a public process that would have allowed for public input into the police chief appointment. They repeatedly said they had no issue with Greenwood himself, but wished for a different selection process. No member of the public brought up a specific concern related to Greenwood's record. Some did question the department's approach to the homeless, and raised concerns about police militarization.\n\"I have no beef with the chief in this moment,\" said Russell Bates, who has been a longtime critic of the department and policing in general. \"In the future, who knows.\" Bates said Greenwood, to date, seemed more \"on the level\" than the city's process overall.\n\"There are a lot of people here, and there have been letters, that call into question\" the process, activist and local resident Steve Martinot told council. \"The issue isn't the man. The issue is the process.\"\nCouncilwoman Cheryl Davila, who had pulled the appointment off the consent calendar, and later abstained from the vote, said she too was displeased with the process.\n\"I think the public should weigh in on you being the chief,\" she said. \"I was hoping [it would happen] before you became chief. But, you know, if you're going to continue, if you're going to be chief, that's ... probably going to happen.\"\nChief Andrew Greenwood listens to City Manager Dee Williams-Ridley make her case for her recommendation to make Greenwood the permanent BPD chief. Photo: Natalie OrensteinCity manager Williams-Ridley said she made her recommendation in support of Greenwood based on his 30 years of service to the Berkeley Police Department, as well as his last six months in the role of acting chief.\n\"This is not an abnormal process that we're going through,\" she said. Williams-Ridley said she picked someone she knew could unite a \"very fractured, very divided\" department, to stabilize it and build morale, and shepherd it through the challenges it has faced in recent years.\n\"It is not an easy thing to do for anyone,\" she said. \"When you have an exemplary record ... in working with people... how far across the nation do I have to go to find someone else to surpass that amount of leadership and courage?\"\nWilliams-Ridley described Berkeley as \"a very tough city to work within,\" but said she loves the challenge, and knows Greenwood does too: \"He's here, and he's been here. He is a committed Berkeley resident born and raised. I wish I could say the same.\"\nChief Andrew Greenwood (right) at a community meeting in January. Photo: Emilie RagusoIn the end, the vote to appoint Greenwood was eight in favor with Davila alone abstaining.\nCouncilman Kriss Worthington said it's the council's job to set policy, and the chief's job to implement it. He called the push for a national search and a series of town halls prior to the hire \"so wrong-headed.\"\n\"We have before us a homegrown leader who has immense experience working to build the faith and the confidence of so many people in Berkeley from so many diverse communities,\" Worthington said. He noted that black, Asian and female officers at BPD have said they feel heard and respected by Greenwood, and are among Greenwood's many supporters in the broader rank and file. \"I think he will listen to all of us and take all of us seriously and give us his recommendations.\"\nCouncilwoman Lori Droste thanked Greenwood for his keen and considerate listening ability over the years, and recalled when they once served together on a city subcommittee.\n\"I would email you and pepper you with questions, and you were always very responsive,\" she said. \"I think that's an incredibly important quality.\"\nChief Greenwood. Photo: BPDCouncilman Ben Bartlett, who also was born and raised in town, recognized Greenwood as \"another native son doing good by Berkeley.\" Bartlett said his father, Dale, who worked deep in Berkeley politics as advisor to former Councilwoman Maudelle Shirek, always spoke highly of Greenwood. And Bartlett said BPD has regularly been responsive when his constituents have raised concerns.\n\"I found that your team represents you quite well, really open arms and inclusive and comforting\" after traumatic situations, Bartlett said. \"You guys also have been really really open to collaboration, and bringing creativity to some of the problems we're facing.\"\nMayor Jesse Arreguin said he too is happy to have a chief with such strong support from within the department, and has been impressed by Greenwood's \"thoughtful and very progressive approach\" to protests that have happened in Berkeley since the presidential election, and his efforts \"to make sure the right to freedom of speech is respected and, at the same time, we are holding people accountable who are committing vandalism and more violence.\"\nArreguin told attendees how Greenwood had just come to a large ACLU meeting focused on Berkeley's sanctuary city status, which may be threatened under President Trump. He said Greenwood promised the group that local officers would continue to follow the city's policy not to enforce federal immigration detainers.\n\"We have a police department that's going to honor the civil rights and civil liberties of all people whether they're citizens of this country or not,\" Arreguin said. Turning to Greenwood, he added: \"You're deeply rooted in this community's values.\"\nA public swearing-in ceremony has been set for April 20.

Photo: Emilie RagusoBy Frances Dinkelspiel and Natalie Orenstein\nIn an unprecedented move, the Berkeley City Council voted Tuesday night to remove two long-standing members of the Board of Library Trustees (BOLT), the first time in the board's 122-year history that members have been removed.\nThe City Council voted 6-2-1 to remove board president Julie Holcomb from the post she has held for six years and 5-3-1 to remove vice president Jim Novosel, who has served the same amount of time. They both had two years left in their terms.\nMayor Jesse Arreguin and council members Kriss Worthington, Ben Bartlett, Cheryl Davila and Kate Harrison voted to remove Holcomb and Novosel; Susan Wengraf and Lori Droste voted no, and Hahn, who also sits on the BOLT, abstained. Linda Maio voted against removing Novosel, whom she said she had known a long time. She voted in favor of removing Holcomb.\n\nJudy Hunt. Photo: Courtesy of Judy HuntCouncil then appointed former Rent Board Commissioner Judy Hunt to fill the vacancy created when Winston Burton retired March 23. Diane Davenport, who once headed the West Branch of the library, and was on Berkeley library staff for 25 years, was also appointed.  She will serve two years. They will join Hahn and Abigail Franklin, whose term expires in January. There is still one vacancy on the board.\nWorthington was the force behind removing Novosel and Holcomb. He said the board had suffered from a lack of leadership; allowed retaliatory actions to happen against library workers who spoke out against book-weeding and other policies; and failed to place a new sign honoring Tarea Hall Pittman on the South Branch building in a timely manner. (See Berkeleyside's March 2 story for full details.)\n\"What choice do we have?\" said Worthington. \"We've lobbied board members and that didn't work. We can't allow the public or librarians to suffer for another year.\"\nBartlett, who was ruled out of order by Holcomb earlier this year when he turned up at a BOLT meeting after public comment was closed and proceeded to speak anyway, said: \"I've never in my life seen a board this disrespectful and exhibit this much vitriol to the people.\"\nHarrison said: \"This is not about a difference in opinion. This is about a failed management approach to employee relations that has led to a hostile and unhealthy workplace.\"\nWengraf raised concerns that Worthington's motion would have serious consequences. The BOLT has been around since 1895 and is a quasi-independent board. It nominates its own members, who are then approved by the City Council. This is the first time the Council has ever removed sitting members, said Wengraf.\n\"I realize I'm in the minority on the dais but my comments come from a real place of concern,\" said Wengraf. \"There's no precedent in the history of Berkeley for this happening... What you are going to do tonight is create an atmosphere of intimidation -- exactly what the librarians are talking about tonight. Does this mean if you are on the BOLT and you don't agree with the council you can be subjected to being removed? ... I kind of see this process as a witch hunt. \"\nAbout 10 community members spoke in favor of removing Novosel and Holcomb.\nThe Board Of Library Trustees for the Berkeley Public Library has been around since 1895 and is a quasi-independent board. Photo: Nancy RubinAndrea Mullarkey, a teen librarian and SEIU Local 1021 shop steward, said she was pleased with the council's actions. Mullarkey was part of a group of vocal library staff that has repeatedly addressed the library board in meetings and has led protests outside the library to convey concern that the board was unresponsive.\n\"I am excited for this fresh start for the library community,\" Mullarkey wrote in an email. \"In the past, we have had a culture of disengagement and an unwillingness to listen that started right at the top with the leadership of the Board of Library Trustees. With the placement of new trustees, one a professional librarian who understands how libraries work, I foresee a future where the library is once again led by people who really want to do this job and who come prepared to serve.\"\nNovosel told Berkeleyside previously that he thought his and Holcomb's ouster was politically motivated. Both of them supported former City Councilman Laurie Capitelli for mayor and in his council district elections against Hahn.\nHolcomb said Wednesday that she agrees with that analysis. She said Arreguin, Hahn and Bartlett had been maneuvering to oust her.\n\"I have known for months that they planned to exact their revenge in this way,\" said Holcomb, who added she was not \"personally wounded,\" by what happened.\nNovosel pointed out Tuesday that neither he nor Holcomb had done anything illegal. He suggested that council allow the board to convene a community committee to examine the issues rather than break up the board.\n\"We have broken no law, performed no malfeasance, nor done anything to deserve such punishment,\" Novosel told the council.\nHis plea did not work as the majority of the council had already made up their minds before the meeting. The board of the Berkeley Public Library Foundation had written a letter to council expressing its opposition to the move to remove two trustees.\nDiane Davenport. Photo: Courtesy Diane DavenportAfter Novosel and Holcomb were deposed, Hahn introduced a motion to appoint Davenport to the library board. Droste then introduced a substitute motion, which Wengraf seconded, that would nominate Hunt, whom the BOLT had previously nominated to replace Burton, and Davenport.\n\"I really want to figure out how to have some sort of kumbaya moment tonight and figure out a way to extend an olive branch and please the multiple parties and stakeholders,\" said Droste.\nWorthington had said a few weeks earlier that he could not support Hunt's nomination because she was a politician. Hunt successfully ran for Rent Board in 2012, opposing a slate that included Alejandro Soto-Vigil, who once worked for Worthington and now works for Arreguin. (Hunt was defeated for re-election in 2016.) Hahn had abstained from voting for Hunt when her nomination came before the board and had tried, unsuccessfully, to nominate Davenport. These allegiances played out in the council vote Tuesday night.\nThe vote to appoint Hunt and Davenport was approved 5-3-1. Maio, Bartlett, Harrison, Wengraf and Droste voted yes. Arreguin, Worthington and Hahn voted no. Davila abstained.\nHolcomb said Hunt was an excellent candidate. The board also wanted to nominate her because Burton, an African-American, was retiring and the board needs diversity. Hunt is African-American.\n\"I am elated at the leadership shown by Lori Droste to derail Sophie Hahn's tenacious campaign against Judy Hunt,\" she said.\nHahn said she did not conduct a \"campaign\" against Hunt. She was just so impressed by Davenport's qualifications that she pushed hard to nominate her to the board.\n\"It was clear to me that she (Davenport) was exceptional and uniquely positioned to put the library back on a course of success and rebuilding morale and flourishing.... It was not about Judy Hunt. It was about Diane Davenport.\"\nWorthington's measure to appoint Davenport and Jeff Chang, a middle school librarian, did not come up for a vote. Worthington said Chang was at the back of the council chambers ready to answer questions. He can be considered for the remaining vacancy or for the spot that opens up when Franklin steps down, said Worthington.\nMany critics of Worthington's measure expressed concern that it would drive away Heidi Dolamore, who took over as library director in September after a long period of turmoil and uncertainty. Two of the last three library directors have left because of severe criticism.\nWorthington addressed this concern in a hand-written amendment that recognized the \"excellence\" of Dolamore and deputy librarian Elliot Warren. He also wrote, \"we do not intend to set a precedent in escalating City Council involvement in day-to-day operations of the Berkeley Public Library.\"\nThe library board had been scheduled to meet Wednesday. The meeting was canceled, however, prior to the council vote.\nEditor's note: This article was updated to include Hahn's comments.\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "Berkeley City Council ousts two library board members", "Tags": "['Berkeley City Council', 'Berkeley Public Library', 'Board of Library Trustees', 'Diane Davenport', 'Jim Novosel', 'Judy Hunt', 'Julie Holcomb']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Library']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley Public Library", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8681512", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "253626", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2706517", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/04/05/berkeley-city-council-ousts-two-library-board-members/", "Author": "Berkeleyside Editors", "Date": "2017-04-05T14:33:55-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "City Manager Dee Williams-Ridley at the Berkeley City Council meeting, March 15, 2016.

The vote was unanimous but four council members were absent.\nOriginal story, 11 a.m. The Berkeley City Council may grant an $800,000 home loan to City Manager Dee Williams-Ridley at a special meeting this afternoon.\nWilliams-Ridley, appointed city manager in March 2016 after a short stint as deputy manager, currently commutes from Sacramento. Her contract entitles her to a loan with a 3% interest rate for purchasing a house within a 10-mile radius of Berkeley.\n\"Recognizing the burden and expense of relocating her family from the Sacramento area, the contract provided for a housing loan,\" today's agenda item says.\n\nAccording to the item, which is sponsored by Mayor Jesse Arreguin, the $800,000 amount is based on house prices in Berkeley and the large difference between prices here and in Sacramento.\nThe loan, which would come out of the city's general fund, supplements Williams-Ridley's $267,648 salary. She has already made offers on homes in the area, according to the item.\n\"City Manager Dee Williams-Ridley considers the move very important to her interest in being more available to the Berkeley community and being able to attend more community events,\" said Matthai Chakko, a spokesman for Berkeley.\nIt is common for cities, including Walnut Creek, Palo Alto and others in the Bay Area, to provide relocation assistance to senior employees so they can live near their place of work. Oakland also has a program offering loans to public safety employees and teachers buying a home for the first time. If authorized, Williams-Ridley's home loan would not be the first given to a Berkeley staff member.\nIn 2009, the City Council gave Michael Meehan, then Berkeley's new police chief, a $500,000, 3% loan, which helped him to buy a house in the Thousand Oaks neighborhood.\nThat loan drew attention when it came out that then-Councilman Lauri Capitelli may have benefited from the sale of the house.\nCapitelli brokered the sale for Red Oak Realty, where he had previously been a partner, and received a $5,925 payment. It had previously, and erroneously according to Capitelli, been reported that the councilman had worked as Meehan's agent and had received a much larger commission. Capitelli donated the fee he received to charity to assuage any ethical concerns. He denied any allegations of ethical misconduct.\nMeehan resigned in September 2016 and the City Council is set to appoint Andrew Greenwood, interim chief, to the position tonight.\nThe special meeting on the home loan begins at 4:30 p.m., followed by another special meeting at 5 p.m. on the city's employee benefits liabilities and park improvement projects. Highlights on the agenda for the regular meeting, which starts at 7 p.m., include the continued zoning appeal for 2902 Adeline Street, the Pathways Program homelessness plan, resolutions to replace the Board of Library Trustees and an ordinance on gender pay equity for city staff and contractors.\nThe City Council meets at Old City Hall at 2134 Martin Luther King Jr. Way.\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "Council set to give Berkeley city manager $800,000 home loan", "Tags": "['Berkeley city budget', 'Berkeley City Council', 'Dee Williams-Ridley', 'Michael Meehan']", "Sections": "['City', 'City']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley City Council", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8694486", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "253493", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2730616", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/04/04/council-set-give-berkeley-city-manager-800000-home-loan/", "Author": "Natalie Orenstein", "Date": "2017-04-04T11:00:37-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Jacob's Wharf c. 1877. The beams of the old pier still make their presence known on east-bound Lower University AvenueAfter a contentious workshop session last Saturday, a number of projects slated for completion under the T1 Bond measure, which Berkeley voters approved in November by 86.6%, will not proceed as planned.\nMuch of the controversy at the session centered on lower University Avenue, particularly the bumpy eastbound lanes between the Marina and Frontage Road. Because this part of the road was built on bay fill, poured in and around the original Jacob's Wharf Pier, it has been subject to uneven settlement around the buried beams of the old structure. Past attempts to smooth out the evenly spaced bumps and hollows have added paving material to fill in the low spots, but this only exacerbated the problem by adding more weight between the old beams, causing the low portions of the roadway to sink even faster while the high points over the beams do not sink at all.\nThe repair plan, estimated to cost between $2 and $3 million, calls for giving up on the south side of the road entirely and relocating all four lanes to the north. This plan would use part of the existing median strip for roadway, but would also cover the abandoned eastbound lanes with topsoil and landscaping.\nThe realignment plan was strongly opposed by Marina residents who disclosed that they had successfully lobbied for designation of the eastbound lanes as a new California Historic Landmark.\n\n\"Our favorite street is now officially recognized for its historic importance as 'The Bumpiest Street in the World,' said Roxanne Scholes, President of the Save the Bumps Coalition, as she briefed the participants in the public workshop. \"San Francisco has benefited from the 'Crookedest Street in the World' since 1922. Lower University Avenue will be an even better tourist attraction, and will bring significant new revenue to local businesses.\"\nNew signage for the eastbound lanes of Lower University AvenueWorkshop participants were divided into small break-out groups of six to eight people per group, plus a facilitator, to document their input to the city's prioritization process. Three minutes later when the break-out time was up, a representative from each of the groups gave a brief summary of their group's priorities for the new mix of T1 infrastructure expenditures.\n\"Our group sees Lower University Avenue as primarily an educational project,\" said Sue Shi, co-owner of the market and deli at Frontage Road and one of the principal supporters of the Bumpiest Street coalition. \"This is not just for tourists. The Visitor Center should feature exhibits depicting the original shoreline, the historic significance of Jacob's Wharf, Spenger's Fish Shack, the City Dump, and the geotechnical dynamics of bay fill and differential settlement. We expect this to become a very popular destination for school field trips and research scholars.\"\n\"We had a good design,\" said Waldo Graide, a civil engineer from Public Works who facilitated another break-out group. \"Yes, it's disappointing to see all the money we spent on planning, design, and permitting go to waste without ever breaking ground on this project. But with Landmark designation, now we can use the T1 funds where they are more urgently needed, upgrading the carpets and air conditioning in City Hall and the Veterans' Building uptown. This will be an important part of the city's emergency resilience program.\"\n2-lane proposal for the re-alignment of Lower University Avenue.4-lane proposal for the re-alignment of Lower University Avenue. Thanks to California Historic Landmark designation, the re-alignment plan will be scrapped.Jocelyn Shaike, who identified herself as a seismic safety consultant, reported that her break-out group was in agreement with the use of T1 funds for interior improvements to the city's administration buildings. \"Sheltering a large number of people in public buildings will be critical after an earthquake,\" she stated. \"Especially considering Berkeley's mild climate and the abundance of tents and sleeping bags among local residents' possessions... No, wait a minute, that didn't come out right...\"\nSue Nahmmie, a member of the City's Resiliency Committee, pointed out that rising sea levels could only enhance the value of lower University Avenue as a historic landmark, especially if it had to be closed at high tide.\n\"Won't the bumps be a major detriment to businesses on the waterfront?\" asked a skeptical workshop participant.\n\"No, we'll just change the speed limit to 40 mph,\" explained Max DeTorr, the city's traffic engineer. \"At that speed, the bumps come too fast to cause resonance in the suspension systems of most vehicles. Only people who drive too slow will feel the full effects of the Bumpiest Street in the World.\" He added that Axel Heist, who operates a brake and alignment shop on San Pablo Avenue, had agreed to sponsor the educational signage.\n\"I don't know what everyone's been complaining about,\" interrupted one workshop participant. \"I drive it at 30, and it's no worse than sailing on San Francisco Bay on any summer afternoon.\"\nThe Save the Bumps Coalition presented some candidate designs for the educational bronze plaques, one to be located at the west end of the road where cars enter, and another one for the new Visitor Center. Located right next to Sea Breeze market, the facility will be shared with the planned visitor center for the McGlaughlin Eastshore State Park.\nOther break-out groups dealt with more contentious issues, especially the city's overall policy for maintaining city streets.\n\"We should be requiring private developers of driveways and commercial parking lots to contribute at least 30% of the construction cost to the Paving Trust Fund,\" insisted Phyllis Stein from the Progressive Paving Action Coalition.\n\"That's not a scalable solution,\" countered detractors of the proposal. According to Rick Shaw, of the Human Powered Transportation Alliance, \"The Paving Trust Fund will only fund a tiny percentage of the streets that need re-paving. It does nothing to alleviate the crisis. Only those few streets that win the paving lottery will ever see new asphalt.\"\n\"Have you no compassion for your car's suspension?\" the progressives shouted back.\n\"Of course we have compassion,\" Shaw responded, despite pleas from the facilitators to stay within the workshop discussion format. \"We need a city-wide solution. Market rate parking can fund the ongoing maintenance of all the streets in the city. It's unfair to only saddle driveways and parking lots you don't like with contributions to the PTF. That is not good paving policy, it's paving obstructionism.\"\nAnother member of the Progressive Paving Action Coalition accused the market-rate advocates of being nothing more than industry shills, accusing Mr. Shaw of being currently retained as a consultant for the Good Intentions Paving Company.\n\"It's a fact that surrounding parking prices always go up as soon as one block allows new paving and market rate parking,\" added Stein. \"I don't care if it is near a paving corridor, that does not justify the displacement.\"\nThe workshop was adjourned while the two factions were each accusing the other of not being the real paving progressives.\nThe East Bay shoreline in 1884.The next public workshop will be held exclusively for the purpose of providing input to the city and commissions regarding who the Bumpiest Street in the World should be named after.\n\"I don't think this will seriously affect the city's overall paving policy, or the implementation of other T1 infrastructure projects,\" said Public Works director Dusty Street after the meeting adjourned. \"We are on track, this is just a bump in the road.\"\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "T1 Bond funding for Lower University Ave. blocked by landmark designation", "Tags": "[]", "Sections": "['City', 'City']", "Natural Language Location": "Lower University Avenue", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8646669", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "253335", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.3103274", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/04/01/t1-bond-funding-lower-university-ave-blocked-landmark-designation/", "Author": "Paul Kamen", "Date": "2017-04-01T09:00:28-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "A fur buyer with a load of deer hides near San Antonio in 1973.

The \"no\" votes, council members Lori Droste, Kriss Worthington and Kate Harrison, said they would have preferred an outright ban rather than the carve-outs Hahn proposed.\n\nCouncilman Worthington brought forward the fur ban to \"foster a consciousness about the\nway we live in the world and create a more humane environment in the City of Berkeley.\" According to his agenda item, which cites the Free Fur Berkeley (FFB) website, more than 30 million animals are killed each year for their fur.\n\"These animals are often victims of cruel conditions that include 'intense stress, distressed and repetitive movement, self-mutilation, and even cannibalism,'\" he wrote, citing the FFB website. \"With the availability of countless varieties of adequate fabrics, there is no need for this brutal industry.\"\nThe city of West Hollywood is reportedly the only other city to implement such a ban, which it passed in 2013. Supporters of the Berkeley ban who spoke to council Tuesday said West Hollywood's ordinance has been successfully defended in court at the state and local levels. Tuesday night, Berkeley became the second city to eliminate the sale of most new fur apparel.\nThe World Society for the Protection of Animals estimates that \"fur farms\" produce 85% of the world's fur, killing millions of mink and foxes every year. \"Raccoon dogs,\" rabbits and chinchillas are other common sources of fur.\nUnlike West Hollywood, which describes itself on its website as \"one of the West Coast's premiere shopping destinations for luxury fashion,\" the city of Berkeley probably doesn't have a lot of fur for sale as it is.\n\"Although virtually no Berkeley businesses sponsor the fur industry's exploitation, this proposed law would ensure they never do,\" Worthington wrote.\nNo one from the public spoke against the fur ban.\n\"It's time for Berkeley to stand up and set an example for the world,\" one woman told officials.\nSaid another, \"I moved to Berkeley because this is a city with a culture of compassion.... Animals' voices are so often silenced. And they have voices.\"\nAccording to the ordinance approved Tuesday, \"The City Council finds that animals who are slaughtered for their fur, whether they are raised on a fur farm or trapped in the wild, endure tremendous suffering. Animals raised on fur farms typically spend their entire lives in cramped and filthy cages. Fur farmers typically use the cheapest killing methods available, including suffocation, electrocution, gas and poison.\"\nThe city initially had included a carve-out for non-profits in the ordinance, but removed that at the time of the vote. The only remaining exceptions are for animal pelts or skins preserved through taxidermy, and used fur products found at second-hand stores, pawn shops and the like.\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "Fur goods now illegal to sell in Berkeley", "Tags": "['Animals in Berkeley', 'Berkeley City Council', 'Kriss Worthington']", "Sections": "['Business', 'Business', 'City']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley City Council", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8694486", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "253211", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2730616", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/31/fur-goods-now-illegal-sell-berkeley/", "Author": "Emilie Raguso", "Date": "2017-03-31T09:00:38-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "The city of Berkeley has been trying to focus its resources for homelessness on people who actually sleep outside on a regular basis. Photo: Emilie RagusoOver the last two years, the city of Berkeley has been moving from an emergency services approach to homelessness to one focused on getting people into long-term housing. It's helped 57 chronically homeless individuals get off the streets.\nTuesday night, director Paul Buddenhagen and manager Kristen Lee from the city's Housing and Community Services department, along with Kathie Barkow of Aspire Consulting, gave the Berkeley City Council a snapshot of the city's shifting approach to what it hopes will one day end homelessness in the community.\nRead Berkeleyside's award-winning coverage of homelessness.The \"system change,\" staff says, has allowed the city to focus more on the highest-need population: people who have lived on Berkeley streets for at least a year and have one or more disabilities. (In San Francisco, the bar is much higher: People need to have been on the street for 13 years to qualify as chronically homeless.) Though some have vociferously criticized Berkeley's efforts over the past six months or so, few complaints were raised Tuesday night.\n\"You're ethical warriors and you represent us quite well because that is the core of our mission in this city,\" Councilman Ben Bartlett told staff. Other city officials shared similar praise in response to the presentation as well.\n\nThe last official estimate, in 2015, put Berkeley's \"literally homeless\" population at about 840; new numbers are expected in June following a recent count.\nLast year, working with the Berkeley Food and Housing Project, the city launched \"The Hub\" -- a \"coordinated entry\" system -- to streamline who gets the most robust services first. That shift came in response to a federal mandate to direct resources to those who need the most help. Berkeley got nearly $5 million from the U.S. Housing & Urban Development department in 2016. Overall, the city spends more than $17 million each year, from federal, state and local sources, on \"a comprehensive constellation of services to help homeless people lead better lives.\"\nHUD money in Berkeley: The city got nearly $5 million in 2016. Source: City of BerkeleyAccording to data collected last year, The Hub tallied more than 7,000 contacts, and screened nearly 1,700 people. Of those, almost 1,000 qualified as chronically homeless. About 270 people with Berkeley ties ranked as \"high needs,\" and another 100 or so were high needs but not from Berkeley. The Hub placed 48 people into housing, nearly 400 into other types of shelter, and referred 136 to a county housing program called Home Stretch. Staff noted that, in 2016, out of all the cities in the county, Berkeley had the highest number of referrals to Home Stretch, and the highest number of people housed.\nSee the presentation and staff report from Tuesday's worksession And the process continues, Buddenhagen said: In March alone, another nine people have already been housed through The Hub.\nIn 2014-15, the city focused 57% of its money on things like drop-in services and other emergency needs. It had \"low investment\" -- just 16% -- in permanent solutions like housing, staff said. And that limited the city's ability to get people off the streets. From 2011 to 2014, Berkeley had a 23% placement rate from shelters into permanent homes, compared to 32% at the county level.\nAfter shifting to the new model, close to 70% of 2016 funding went toward services designed to help people access housing and stay there, staff said. In other cities around the nation, a prioritization model of who gets the bulk of the help has had significant results, and seen double-digit reductions in the size of certain homeless populations.\nStaff gave the Berkeley City Council an update Tuesday about its changing approach to homelessness. Photo: Emilie RagusoIn 2015, 40% of the people getting help through Berkeley shelters did not meet the city's definition for \"literally homeless.\" The new system -- which has seen a 33% increase in the number of \"literally homeless\" individuals served -- puts the focus on people who are living in parks, doorways and encampments, the city says. It recognizes that there simply isn't enough money to help everyone. The old system was focused on managing homelessness, director Buddenhagen told council. The new one is working to end it.\nThat's not to say the shelter system will go away, but it has a different place in the city's overall approach, he said.\nSam, who slipped through the cracks in the old system, has now been housed, staff says. Photo: City of BerkeleyOne person helped under the new system, Buddenhagen told council, was an elderly man named Sam. He'd been living on the street for 10 years, and had been \"struggling mightily.\" Through The Hub, Sam was placed in an SRO in Oakland, and is now on the list for permanent supportive housing. He's getting help with mental health needs, and got a new pair of glasses from Berkeley's Suitcase Clinic so he can see again.\n\"Sam struggled for 10 years on the streets of Berkeley prior to The Hub because the system wasn't designed to provide services for Sam,\" Buddenhagen said. \"He needed support and he got it.\"\nNow, the city is seeking county funding to become one of five hubs that will work together, along with an overall call center, in an even more coordinated way. Berkeley is working with Albany and Emeryville for its main application, and in collaboration with Oakland to help support homeless families. Buddenhagen said Berkeley should be in a good position for its application because it was \"first out of the gate\" to create its own comprehensive hub. That funding is set to kick in later this year, and could mean millions of dollars more for Berkeley.\nStaff said the city continues to improve the new system and is working to strengthen its partnerships with and among Berkeley service providers. It's continuing to refine how it assesses need and, as one example, has tweaked the formula so homeless youth have a better shot at getting help. The city is also working to improve its case management services and skills through training and better collaboration.\nStaff noted that, of the 57 housing placements so far, only 9% have been in Berkeley due to the city's high housing costs and limited supply. Many people have been housed in Oakland, though others have been placed as far away as Stockton. On a brighter note, staff said, all clients get calls and visits from outreach workers to help them stay on track.\nStaff took an in-depth look at homeless services in NovemberBuddenhagen said the city is waiting to see what the federal government plans to do in terms of funding going forward, because proposed budget cuts to programs like Shelter Plus Care and Section 8 could put the city in a very tough spot. President Trump has already proposed slashing HUD's Community Development Block Grant Program, which provides important funding to the city.\n\"We would be in a world of trouble, that's just a simple fact. We can't as a jurisdiction make that up,\" he said. \"We have to just keep watching.\"\nCouncil members said they were impressed with the report, and with the work that has been done.\n\"I feel like we're doing so much, and that this transition to The Hub system has really helped to figure out exactly what we're doing for whom,\" said Councilwoman Susan Wengraf. \"Prior to that, it was a little more confused.\"\nCouncilman Kriss Worthington credited Councilwoman Linda Maio with being the first person, several years ago, to try to bring homeless service providers together to begin a collaboration process that preceded The Hub. And he said Berkeley is lucky to have a mayor -- Jesse Arreguin -- who has said ending homelessness is the city's top priority.\nWorthington also said he supports the new prioritization model, though the shift hasn't been easy.\n\"This is morally good for the poor people who are suffering,\" he said. \"When we achieve success, it will also be good for the business community and the city of Berkeley. To actually have effective services for people who are homeless will benefit all of us.\"\nCouncilwoman Sophie Hahn said what the city really needs to do is go even further: to come up with a plan to address \"extreme poverty.\" She noted that Berkeley has been said to have the largest wealth gap of any city in California.\n\"I'm not proud of that level of diversity,\" she said. \"Having a lot of very poor people in a city that also has a lot of wealth is not something I'm proud of.\"\nRendering of the STAIR Center.

In addition to the Acheson Commons project, Mill Creek is the developer that intends to build an 18-story structure on the current site of the Walgreen's at Shattuck Avenue and Allston Way.\nMill Creek purchased Acheson Commons from Equity Residential in September. Equity Residential put its portfolio of eight Berkeley apartment complexes with 452 apartments on the market in November 2015, but has only sold this parcel so far. Equity, a publicly traded company started by the Chicago developer Sam Zell, hoped to sell the entire portfolio because it was shifting its focus to high-end urban properties rather than university-related ones, John Hyjer, first vice-president of investment for Equity Residential, told Berkeleyside in September. It later removed the package from the market.\n\nA rendering of what Acheson Commons should look like.

Designed originally by the architect Kirk Peterson, it calls for the historic facades of the buildings in the 2100 block of University Avenue to be retained, with construction rising behind them.\nIn the plan, the one-story building on the corner of University and Shattuck avenues would be redone as the six-story MacFarlane Building, named after the candy store that once operated there. The historic Acheson Physicians Building in the middle of the block, currently used as offices, would become apartments with a restored exterior.  The exterior of the former Ace Hardware building, which is landmarked, would be incorporated into a new six-story building. The Bachenheimer Building, a relatively new structure, would be incorporated into the complex. There will be 34,000 square feet of commercial space in the building.\nWhen the project was first approved, it was the largest in Berkeley's history.

Photo: Courtesy Zack KushnerBerkeley is probably the furthest thing from Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan's mind right now, what with the the stinging defeat of the Republican healthcare bill, but Ryan is very much on the mind of Berkeley activist Zack Kushner. Kushner -- no relation to Jared -- is the mastermind of the successful Ides of Trump postcard-writing campaign whose goal was to mail 1 million postcards to the Trump White House on March 15.\nAs an encore, Kushner wants to mail 1 million postcards to House Speaker Paul Ryan on April 17.\n\"Ryan is enabling Donald Trump,\" Kushner said last week. \"He has the power to stop him; he could have the House investigate the Russia connection; he could organize House Republicans to block some of the more odious nominees -- but he's not doing any of that.\"\nThe Ides of Trump started more or less accidentally, as a result of Kushner's experience with the Oakland Women's March on Jan. 21. And it quickly took on a life of its own.\n\n\"It's an understatement to assume that I had thought everything through as well as I should have,\" Kushner said, looking back.\nWhat happened was this: on the day of the march, like thousands of other Berkeleyans, Kushner took his family to a local BART station and found himself in a line that was an hour long. His wife had a migraine, his toddler was in a stroller, and quickly lost a boot. How could they survive this march? For a while, they persisted: they made it onto the train, got to Oakland, and then found themselves squeezed among thousands of marchers. It was not a good situation for their young family, and they soon turned around and went back home.\nBut Kushner began wondering how many other people might have wanted to go to the march, but couldn't attend because they were elderly, or disabled, or lived too far from public transportation.\n\"I thought there had to be a way for those people to be heard,\" he said. \"One of the things that made the march so incredible were all those signs, where each person wrote what was most important to them. I thought there had to be a creative way for people who couldn't attend the march to still be able to resist.\"\nThat is where the idea of the postcards came from.\n\"I thought people might want to do something more than sign a petition,\" Kushner said.\nPostcards. Photo: Courtesy Zack KushnerSo, the morning after the march, he woke up, wrote a few sentences, and put them up on Facebook. The concept: everyone should send one or more postcards on the same day -- March 15 -- making clear their resistance to Trump, with the goal to create a deluge of 1 million postcards addressed to the White House.\nKushner sent the initial page to a few friends, asking for some help with graphics and a banner. But one of his friends did not realize that the page was still in beta, and started sending it to all his friends.\nKushner, a contract writer and digital strategist in his mid-40s, said that he has lived through presidential administrations that he has vehemently disagreed with in the past, but he has never been an activist before. Donald Trump's election changed all that.\n\"My interest is to get one specific person out of government, and that person is Donald Trump. He has no business running this country: he is not safe, he is not sane, and I am going to do everything I can to get rid of him.\"\nA week after that initial Facebook post, there were 10,000 people following the page, Kushner said.\nA postcard writing party. Photo: Ides of Trump/Instagram\"It was huge, and it was growing. We built a Twitter page, signed up for Instagram, and starting moderating the Ides of Trump Facebook page,\" he said. What started out as \"a good idea among friends\" became a \"political campaign with legs\" in a matter of days. \"We were just doing everything we could to keep it going, to make the right decisions, and to learn. We did all of those things as quickly as possible, and we are now doing our best to pivot for a second round, which we hope will be successful in other ways.\"\nThe Ides of Trump is now a three-person project consisting of Kushner; his friend Ted Sullivan, a television writer from Los Angeles; and a marketer from northern California called Jennifer Jones, who volunteered to build the website, but has yet to meet Kushner or Sullivan in person.\n\"We realized we had to do more than just ruin Donald Trump's day\"\nWhen asked about his early expectations for the Ides of Trump, Kushner said it's hard to remember, because so much has changed in his thinking in the past two months. \"My original idea was just to keep the pressure on Donald Trump, to get under his skin, and to keep him from feeling comfortable for as long as possible,\" he said. \"But as the reality of his government set in, and the numbers of our followers started to really grow, we realized we had to do more than just ruin Donald Trump's day.\"\nAt some point, as enthusiasm for the Ides of Trump postcard campaign took off, Kushner began to think maybe his group really could generate a million postcards to Donald Trump. Postcards were sent from red states as well as blue states, and from countries as far flung as New Zealand, Australia, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Spain and England. Kushner guesses that expats are largely responsible for the postcards that were written abroad, but he has no way of knowing who actually sent those cards.\nIn Berkeley, the Story Center held a postcard-writing event on March 15, and Berkeley residents contributed several hundred postcards to the national effort.\nKushner got most reports of postcard efforts through social media, but eventually discovered that most people who wrote postcards were older and did not have Facebook or Twitter accounts. He also found that most people wrote more than one postcard: the median was a dozen postcards a person, Kushner said.\nEven dogs got in on the Ides of Trump act. Photo: Ides of Trump/Instagram\"I think people wrote multiple postcards for a variety of reasons. They found it to be a really cathartic experience: it made them feel really good to get this anger and frustration on paper, and then to send it away,\" he said. People also enjoyed the social aspect of postcard writing parties.\n\"One of the most beautiful things about this campaign is that it's chaotic,\" he said. \"Everybody feels free to say what they want to say in their own way. We are by design not printing postcards with messages on them. People are creating their own amazingly creative, funny postcards.\" Many of those postcards have been posted on Facebook, and on the Ides of March website.\nBut as momentum and expectations grew, Facebook followers began to demand some accountability and feedback: how many postcards were actually delivered to the White House in the days around March 15? Was it really a million, or more, or less? They wanted answers, but Kushner said the exact number may be impossible to know. For one thing, presidential mail is delivered to a warehouse to be sorted, and the press is not allowed access to this warehouse. So it was impossible to get photos or a count of the number of postcards that were delivered, and there was no media coverage of the final results.\nKushner did some calculations, which he posted on Facebook and on the website, but in the final analysis it was an educated guess more than an actual count. (See a more detailed analysis.)\nA war-chest to take on the House Speaker\nAs for Paul Ryan, normally he could not be influenced by people outside his district (other than wealthy donors), because usually only his constituents could vote him in or out of office. But in a unique twist, Kushner is suggesting that everyone who sends a postcard to Ryan also contribute a few dollars to a fund that will be used to support a Ryan challenger in 2018. The fact that no-one has yet declared for this race does not concern Kushner: he believes that the creation of a significant war chest will encourage candidates to take on the House leader and one-time vice-presidential hopeful.\nThe second target in the Ides of Trump campaign is House Speaker Paul Ryan. Photo: Ides of Trump/Facebook\"We are encouraging each postcard writer to indicate how much money they gave to this fund right on the postcard: we will print and sell stickers that say 'I donated $1, $5, or $20,'\" Kushner said. \"We want Ryan to see a mountain of postcards from people who are motivated financially to take him down.\" Since Kushner's group has not yet created this fund, for now he is urging people to send money to existing organizations such as Swing Left, the ACLU, the Southern Poverty Law Center, Planned Parenthood, and EarthJustice.\nAnd when it comes to tracking results, Kushner is hoping to get \"better visuals\" for the Ryan campaign, since Ryan's mail is delivered to his congressional office in Wisconsin rather than an anonymous and well-guarded warehouse.\nHe is also asking those mailing postcards to use the hashtag #TheIdes, so the group can keep track of donations for this specific election.\nKushner said he is \"trying to keep expectations reasonable\" for this second campaign, \"but what we don't get done for this one we will do in the next one. We want to keep that resistance pressure up as much as possible.\" People are already sending in suggestions for a May postcard recipient, but Kushner hasn't made that decision yet. For now, his focus remains resolutely on Paul Ryan and a more visible mountain of postcards.\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "Activist behind '1M postcards to Trump' campaign sets sights on Paul Ryan", "Tags": "['Donald Trump']", "Sections": "['Community', 'Community', 'Politics']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley Story Center", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8685408", "Zip Code": "94702", "ID": "252725", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2891871", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/28/berkeley-activist-behind-1m-postcards-trump-campaign-sets-sights-paul-ryan/", "Author": "Daphne White", "Date": "2017-03-28T10:00:08-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "The Berkeley City Council will consider Tuesday buying the old Premier Cru building at 1011 University Ave. The Council would then hold its meetings in the award-winning space. Photo: Berkeley Design AdvocatesUpdate, March 29: Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to go ahead with the purchase, but, in an amendment put forward by City Councilwoman Kate Harrison, to pay back the cost of borrowing money for the construction of new Council chambers with funds from excess property transfer taxes, not Measure U1 funds.  If the City Council builds affordable housing on the site, Measure U1 funds may be used to repay the loan for that portion of the complex. \"The remainder will be paid from an appropriate source after the use of the building is determined and the repayment plan is reviewed by the Housing Advisory Commission if required,\" according to the amendment. Said Councilwoman Linda Maio: \"We are really concerned about public safety. We have to get out of this building.\" Current estimates are that the new building could be ready within six months to a year. The city has been trying to get out of Old City Hall since 2002, staff said Tuesday, but none of the available options has been considered appropriate.\nOriginal story: The City Council will vote Tuesday on an emergency ordinance to buy the old Premier Cru building complex on University Avenue for $6.65 million with the aim of using the site for future City Council chambers and ultimately, affordable housing.\nThe complex includes four different addresses on three parcels: 1001 University Ave., 1007 University Ave., 1011 University Ave. and 1925 Ninth Street site. Bauman College: Holistic Nutrition and Culinary Arts currently occupies one of the buildings and the city's plans would not interrupt their long-term operations, according to Jovan Grogan, Berkeley's deputy city manager.\nBerkeley is interested in buying the property because it is well situated for affordable housing, said Grogan. The parcel, at .864 of an acre, is big enough and the property sits on along a major transit corridor, he said. It is right near Interstate 80, businesses and schools as well. (It is one mile from the nearest BART station at North Berkeley.) The land is also zoned for commercial and residential development.\n\nBerkeley plans to pay for the land by borrowing the funds from the city's Workers' Compensation Fund 875. It will repay the funds from money generated from excess property taxes and Measure U1, the new business tax on rental properties that voters approved in November. The funds will be repaid with interest, said city spokesman Matthai Chakko. The City Council still has to determine terms of the repayment and a timeline, according to Chakko.\nIn the short term, Berkeley could use Premier Cru's former retail showroom for City Council meetings, said Grogan. The room is gorgeous with bamboo floors and mahogany shelving. It would need a bit of remodeling, such as enlarging the bathrooms and taking down some non-load-bearing walls, to adapt it for Council chambers, he said. A small room off the main room could be converted to an overflow room, too, he said. The new chambers might be ready to use six months to a year after the real-estate deal closes, he said.\n\"This is a beautiful place and it's already almost laid out for us,\" said Grogan.\nThe City Council currently meets in Old City Hall, which is seismically unsafe. Berkeley is still considering ways to retrofit that building, named after former City Councilwoman Maudelle Shirek, and the old Veteran's Building.\nIt will take from five to seven years to put together a package to build affordable housing on the former Premier Cru site, said Grogan. The city will work with non-profit affordable housing builders and will have to arrange financing in order to complete the project. In that time, he said he hopes Berkeley will make progress in figuring out how to upgrade the Civic Center.\nBerkeley has been looking for years for sites to build affordable housing but there have not been many sites large enough, said Grogan. That is why staffers got so excited about this complex.\nA February report presented to the City Council examined all 119 city-owned properties and assessed each parcel for its development potential. Six sites had potential. One, on Berkeley Way, already has plans for homeless housing. Another, the parking lot behind stores on College Avenue also had potential, but some challenges as well. The remaining four parcels significant challenges, according to the report.\nIf Berkeley acquires the old Premier Cru complex for $6.65M, it will have almost an acre of land onto which it can place affordable housing. Photo: Gordon CommercialThe city would also earn revenue in the purchase since Bauman College leases 1007 University Ave. for about $100,000 a year, according to a staff report. The college has a lease through 2021 and two five-year options to extend. (The Bauman building is a historic building and would not be razed to build housing, said Grogan.)\nThe staff report also says Berkeley could consider using the complex for a navigation center for the homeless, but Chakko said using it for City Council chambers seems more likely now.\nRead the full Berkeleyside expose on Premier Cru.John Fox and Hector Ortega, the former owners of the wine retailer Premier Cru, moved their operations from Emeryville into the complex in 2011. The pair had formed an LLC, 1011 University, to hold the property. To finance its acquisition and substantial remodeling, 1011 University LLC borrowed $3.8 million from the Taylor Family Trust, funds from the Community Bank of the Bay, and more than $800,000 from Saul Gevertz, the owner of Eden Jewelry and Loan Co. in Hayward, according to court documents.\nPremier Cru filed for bankruptcy in January 2016. The bankruptcy trustee worked out a deal with Gevertz, the LLC's managing partner, to stay in the complex until the company's 79,000 bottles of wine could be sold or given to their rightful owners. The Taylor Family Trust filed a lien against the property, according to George King, the trust's attorney. Alameda County then placed the complex on its list of properties to be auctioned in March because the LLC owed $171,875 in back taxes, according to public records. It was pulled off once the county became aware it was part of bankruptcy proceedings, said Julie Manaois, Alameda County's chief deputy tax collector. Gordon Commercial once again listed the property for sale. (It had been listed for $7.8 million in 2015. The price later dropped to $6.8 million).\nFox pleaded guilty in December to one count of wire fraud and was sentenced recently to 6.5 years in federal prison. Fox admitted to running a $55 million wine Ponzi scheme. He admitted in court that he spent about five million on buying nice houses and cars, sending his daughter to college, and meeting young women online for dates.\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "City Council set to buy West Berkeley building; may move meetings there", "Tags": "['1011 University Ave.', 'Berkeley City Council', 'John Fox', 'Measure U1', 'Premier Cru', 'Saul Gevertz', 'University Avenue']", "Sections": "['City', 'City']", "Natural Language Location": "1011 University Ave", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8691454", "Zip Code": "94710", "ID": "252757", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2959217", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/27/city-council-set-buy-west-berkeley-building-will-move-meetings/", "Author": "Frances Dinkelspiel", "Date": "2017-03-27T15:24:29-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "The Adeline Corridor plan include possible new sites for the Berkeley Flea Market. Photo: Natalie OrensteinPicture Adeline Street converted into a narrower, park-lined roadway with protected bike lanes on either side. Imagine the Ashby BART station relocated underground, making way for new development and a public park up top.\nThese and other ideas for the future of Adeline Street and its surroundings have been made manifest in the form of miniature foam models, on view this week at the Ed Roberts Campus. The exhibit, \"Re-Imagine Adeline,\" is the city of Berkeley's latest step in drafting a long-term plan for the redevelopment of a 100-acre stretch of Shattuck Avenue and Adeline between Dwight Way and the Oakland border.\nAfter receiving a $750,000 planning grant from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in 2014, the city and Berkeley-based consultant MIG hosted a number of public workshops and analyzed initial possibilities for the roadway and public lots. Since the last public meeting in May 2016, the city has decided to stop working with MIG and is in the process of selecting a new consultant.\nAfter a pause in the public engagement process, the Adeline Corridor project has resurfaced in 2017 with the exhibit, first open in January and now back through Friday, March 31. Visitors can provide feedback at the exhibit or online.\n\nNeighbors take a look at Adeline Corridor models with city planner Alene Pearson (center). Photo: Natalie OrensteinThe ideas put forth in the exhibit are broad and do not drill down to design details.\n\"We're showing some pretty high-level concepts to see if there's consensus on a long-term plan for our open space,\" said Alisa Shen, the principal planner. The draft plan, initially expected to be completed this spring but now slated for 2018, will also address housing and economic development, both dominant themes in public feedback so far.\nRe-Imagine Adeline presents three possibilities for the roadway and surrounding public space. The 180-foot-wide street -- a vestige of Adeline's past as a street-car line -- is not as safe or friendly to pedestrians or cyclists as it could be and leaves ample room for other improvements, city planners say.\nEach option in the exhibit includes narrower lanes and parallel parking along Adeline, providing a buffer for continuous bike lanes. In each, some car lanes are eliminated and Ashby BART parking is moved below-grade, opening up the lot for new development and other uses.\nIn one option, there is a linear park to the west of the roadway. In this proposal, two-thirds of the BART parking lot is occupied by new development, with a park -- including one acre designated for the flea market -- covering the rest. There is another park at Adeline and Stanford for the farmer's market.\nAnother option puts car traffic in the middle of the road with green space flanking it. The flea market gets a one-acre paved plaza on the current BART parking lot, and the farmer's market gets a new designated site too, at Adeline and Stanford.\nThe third option extends the existing median on Adeline, envisioning it as a site for community events. In this option, which creates the least green space, part of Adeline is closed off on weekends to hold the flea market.\nPhoto: City of BerkeleyResidents have said they fear the Adeline Corridor plan will displace the flea market, which occupies most of the BART parking lot every weekend. During community input events in 2015 and 2016 neighbors said the market is a cultural institution and a source of income for the vendors.\nAnother section of the exhibit features \"What If?\" ideas -- images of kiosk stations, canopies and other \"out-of-the-box\" ideas for various sites along the corridor.\nOn Saturday afternoon the exhibit brought in a handful of neighbors and passers-by.\nJay Castle, a North Oakland resident who lives right across the border, said it was helpful to see the ideas in 3-D. He said he spends a lot of time in South Berkeley with his young son and sees room for improvement.\n\"I'm glad this is happening,\" he said. \"For me, the biggest thing I'd like to see is traffic slowed down through the neighborhood. I'm as fearful when I'm driving as I am walking.\"\nOthers were less impressed with the display.\n\"This is not my fist rodeo,\" said Richie Smith, who has lived in South Berkeley since 1949. \"I have files of plans that come through here and they never get the money and it never comes to fruition.\"\nShe said she worries the plan could invite development that pushes out residents of color and neglects the neighborhood's history.\nSouth Berkeley has changed tremendously since the 1940s. First home to a large Japanese-American population, many of whom were forced to abandon their homes when they were sent to internment camps, the neighborhood became home base for many African Americans, like Smith and her family, who moved to the area during and after World War II. In 1990 nearly half of the Adeline Corridor's residents were Black, according to the city, but the population had plummeted to 20% by 2013.\nA three-dimensional rendering of an idea for the Adeline Corridor roadway. Photo: Natalie OrensteinAlthough it used to be much cheaper than other nearby neighborhoods, South Berkeley, like all of the Bay Area, has grown far less affordable in recent years. Analysis by MIG in 2016 found the median house price in the project area was $759,000. The study found that two-thirds of the units in the area were rentals, and two-thirds of those were rent-controlled. The remaining market-rate units were $400 more on average than others.\nEarlier this month, a project that would add a six-story complex with 50 mostly market-rate units to the corridor was put on hold after a potential deal between the developer and neighbors fell apart.\nAt community input meetings, residents implored the city to include measures in the plan to prevent displacement and honor the corridor's legacy of diversity.\nOne of the reasons the city is seeking a new consultant is to find a group especially equipped to engage residents of color in the planning process, Shen said.\nThe city is also looking for a consultant who \"can better translate feedback we're getting into actual recommendations,\" she said.\nThe new consultant, likely selected in April, will consider feedback from the Re-Imagine Adeline exhibit and previous analyses to come up with a single proposal for the roadway and public lots. The group will also focus on housing, land use and economic development policy, ultimately developing the draft plan and conducting an environmental review. There will be additional community outreach events.\nThe draft plan will include a possible financing plan but the grants funds only cover planning.\n\"We tell the community it's still worth it to have a plan to serve as a blueprint in terms of stating to city decision-makers what the community's vision is,\" Shen said.\nRe-Imagine Adeline is up through Friday, March 31. The city will collect feedback questionnaires through Saturday, April 8.

Photo: Tracey TaylorCity Councilman Kriss Worthington, Mayor Jesse Arreguin and two other City Council members are pushing to reconstitute the Board of Library Trustees (BOLT) and replace two of its members because they believe the existing entity has made a number of grievous missteps that have led to low employee morale and may have opened the city up to potential lawsuits.\nWorthington and Arreguin, along with Ben Bartlett and Cheryl Davila, are putting forth a measure for the April 4 council meeting. The resolution calls for a \"fresh start\" and \"reconstitution\" of the Library Board either by asking for the resignations of President Julie Holcomb and Vice President Jim Novosel, or, \"if not forthcoming, then [their] removal and replacement.\" Worthington's original plan, submitted to the Agenda Committee, had been to also call for the resignation of Abigail Franklin, but he has since rescinded that provision. A fourth BOLT member, Winston Burton, is scheduled to retire March 23.\nRead Berkeleyside's March 2 story on unrest within the Berkeley Public Library.The unprecedented measure may almost be a fait accompli, as the City Charter says library trustees can be removed by a vote of five City Council members. City Councilwoman Sophie Hahn, who is the new City Council representative on BOLT, has stated that she thinks the board would benefit from new leadership.*\n\"There's been a series of unfortunate, outrageous, illegal proposals, inappropriate, disrespectful activities,\" said Worthington. \"It's years worth of violations of policies, law, and protocol that have been building up.\"\n\nHe cited as reasons to remove the two board members the long delay in installing a new sign renaming one branch the Tarea Hall Pittman/South Branch Library; a 10-month-long amorphous investigation into certain library employees; and what he termed a board election process that \"has developed from fiasco to farce.\"\nThe Board of Library Trustees, l to r: Jim Novosel, Abigail Franklin, Winston Burton, Julie Holcomb and Sophie Hahn. Photo: Berkeley Public LibraryHowever, the targeted BOLT members and their allies believe the current council is exaggerating the library's issues and using the cover of library employee dissatisfaction to purge its political opponents. Holcomb and Novosel have been long-time supporters or allies of former City Councilman Laurie Capitelli, who lost his bid for mayor to Arreguin in November 2016. Novosel also challenged Arreguin in 2010 in a race for the District 4 City Council seat and lost.\n\"It's a complete political witch hunt,\" said Novosel. \"It's a complete cleansing of people who aren't part of the new political order in Berkeley.\"\nAll of the targeted BOLT members said they will not resign. Neither Holcomb nor Franklin wanted to go on the record about the controversy.\nThe board of the Berkeley Public Library Foundation, an independent nonprofit that has raised $8 million for the library in the past 20 years, is also concerned about Worthington's proposal. The foundation is worried that the measure to recall, or force the resignations of, two members will undermine faith in the library and lead to less financial support.\n\"We are deeply concerned about any politicization of an institution that is meant to be independent,\" said Rachel Anderson, the president of the foundation board. \"Decades ago our city leaders made this wise decision. They put distance between political influence and the library's governance. To politicize the library board would have a negative impact on the library's reputation.\"\nIn a letter sent March 18 from the entire foundation board, the foundation wrote: \"The attempts to remove and replace Library Trustees midterm risks further destabilizing the Library. We fear this would have a negative impact on the Library's reputation and on the future of both public funding and the Foundation's efforts to raise private support from Berkeley's residents.\"\nOthers are concerned that a \"reconstitution\" of BOLT might drive away the recently hired top library staff, making it difficult to attract competent candidates. There has been a cloud over the departure of two of the last three library directors. Heidi Dolamore was hired as library director in September and Elliot Warren only came on as the deputy director in February.\n\"We're setting the stage not to be able to hire a library director in the future,\" said Councilwoman Susan Wengraf. \"Who is going to want to come here and be the library director?\"\nWorthington has repeatedly said he wants Dolamore to stay.\nMany library staff and community members support Worthington's proposal, however, stating that they think the BOLT members are unresponsive to the community's needs. A group of former librarians, community supporters, and some staff held a rally on Thursday March 16 outside the Central Branch that called for the ouster of BOLT.\n\"A lot of people have lost faith in the BOLT because it doesn't do anything,\" said one long-time library staffer who asked not to be named. \"When staff brings up issues, they look off into the distance and they completely ignore what has been said. Then they carry on with their agenda - items the director has prepared.\"\nThis comment seems to get to the heart of the controversy: just how much authority does BOLT have over the inner workings of the library? BOLT members believe their authority is limited; their main function is to set overall policy, hire a director and let him or her run the institution. Some of the BOLT members say they are being blamed for issues over which they have no control as it is up to the library director to resolve personnel and facilities issues.\nBOLT critics disagree and say the board should, and must, intervene to assure the library is run well and staff is heard.\n\"We need a new board of directors, basically,\" said Charles Austin, the South Berkeley resident who led the push to rename the South Branch in honor of Pittman, a radio host and longtime civil-rights leader.\nBerkeley Public Library's Central Branch in downtown Berkeley. Photo: Nancy RubinThe origins of the Berkeley Public Library and the Board of Library Trustees\nThe way the public library became part of Berkeley may be part of the issue, as the library board has always been a quasi-independent body, even though the City Council has the right to appoint and relieve members of their positions. In fact, as Worthington points out, the Library Board has more power and independence than any of Berkeley's commissions.\nThe first circulating library in the town of Berkeley was The Free Reading Room, which opened March 18, 1882, in a building on Shattuck and University avenues, according to the 1931 book, Berkeley's First Public Library, by William Warren Ferrier. It was stocked with 54 books, daily newspapers, the New York Weekly Tribune, Harper's magazine and Century magazine. The reading room shut down six months later.\nIt would take another 11 years to bring a library to Berkeley. In February 1893, the Holmes Public Library opened its doors in the Shattuck Block. A group of men had formed the library association and paid $1 a month to keep it going. Other patrons paid $1 a year for the right to take out books. The Women's Christian Temperance Union donated 250 books and the library was open from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. daily.\nFrom the start, the library was a hit and soon it was drawing 200 visitors a day. The library's popularity - and calls to open branches in West Berkeley and the Lorin District, promoted a move to hand over the Holmes Public Library to Berkeley. The town agreed to levy a library tax. On Dec. 11, 1895, Berkeley took over the library and appointed a board of directors to oversee its operations, according to Ferrier. This is the first mention of a BOLT board. Francis K. Shattuck was elected president of the board.\nIn 1896, the name of the Holmes Public Library was changed to the Berkeley Public Library. Rosa Shattuck, Francis K. Shattuck's widow, eventually donated a lot on Kittredge Street and Shattuck Avenue worth $30,000 to the town of Berkeley for a new library building, which is known as the Central Branch today. Andrew Carnegie donated $40,000 to construct the building.\nThe town of Berkeley eventually became the city of Berkeley and, in 1923, it adopted a City Manager form of government. The charter and municipal code laid out the structure of BOLT and its responsibilities. It is a five-member board, with one member coming from the City Council. The members are appointed by the Council and \"shall be subject to removal from the board at the pleasure of the City Council, prior to the expiration of the term for which they were appointed,\" according to the Berkeley Municipal Code, section 3.04.010. In practice, BOLT has often chosen new board members and sent the nominations to the City Council for approval.\nThe early BOLT boards were given wide discretion over the internal operations of the library - and this authority now seems to be at the center of the question over whether BOLT has been sufficiently responsive to community concerns. The Municipal Code reads that BOLT shall have the power:\nTo make and enforce all rules, regulations, and bylaws necessary for the administration, government and protection of such library, and all property belonging thereto or that may be loaned, devised, bequeathed or donated to the same;\nTo administer any trust declared or created for such library and to provide memorial tablets and niches to perpetuate the memory of those persons who may make valuable donations thereto;\nTo purchase necessary books, journals, publications and other supplies and personal property;\nTo appoint officers and employees of the library, either full-time or part-time, as may be necessary to adequately conduct the business of the library, said officers and employees to hold office at the pleasure of the board; to fix the salaries and wages thereof within the salary ranges established by resolution of the City Council, and to prescribe the duties and powers of such officers and employees.\nClearly, some of those provisions are out of date. BOLT plays no role in buying books. Union contracts now take precedence over BOLT's ability to set wages. The board no longer oversees the creation of niches where donors can be commemorated.\nAnd, in 2007, BOLT passed a resolution formally handing over the day-to-day responsibility of library operations to the director, who at that time was Donna Corbeil.\n\"It is not uncommon for legislative bodies responsible for substantial organizations to rely on their employees to do a great deal of the actual work of the organization,\" City Attorney Zach Cowan wrote in an email to Berkeleyside. Cowan would not speak directly to how he has advised BOLT about how much authority members hold to run the actual operations of the library. He said that would be a breach of attorney-client privilege.\nAs controversies have arisen, many BOLT members believed they had to take a hands-off approach and let the library director handle the issues. (The handling of many issues has been further complicated by the fact there were only acting directors from the time Jeff Scott resigned in August 2015 until Dolamore came on board at the end of September 2016.) Many people in the community, however, believe BOLT should be a hands-on board.\n\"I do not believe anyone on the board should get involved with an individual [staff] matter, but the board is .... not addressing systematic policy problems,\" said Worthington.\nControversy is nothing new at the Berkeley Public Library\nKriss Worthington. Photo: Courtesy of Kriss WorthingtonWorthington's measure outlines three current areas of controversy at the library -- issues he considers so grave that the board needs to be changed. But various BOLT members, who did not want to be quoted, said the problems did not begin with them. The Berkeley Public Library has been embroiled in numerous conflicts over the years.\nFor example, in 2005, many community members protested the then head of the library Jackie Griffin's plan to automate check-outs by installing computerized RFID chips in books. There were rallies and protests against this plan, in part because the new technology would lead to a reduction in library staff and in part because of privacy concerns. The controversy eventually led to Griffin's departure.\nMore recently, Berkeleyside reported on March 2 that numerous library staffers said there was an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust at the library. One main cause stemmed from an investigation launched in April 2016 by then Interim Library Director Beth Pollard into the actions of several employees. Pollard never publicly articulated what an outside investigator was looking into, and only told those being investigated that it was for \"potential misconduct.\" But it appeared to center on various librarians who used their own library cards, or in one case, the library card of a family member, to check out numerous books. Many librarians have admitted doing this as a way to circumvent elements of the library's weeding process -- which itself triggered a huge controversy in recent years. The library administration investigated whether those actions were illegal.\nWhen Dolamore took over in September, she inherited the investigation and the discontent it was causing. While she told BOLT the investigation had been completed in January, she did not until last week inform the five staff members under investigation -- Berkeleyside had originally been told by staff that seven were being examined -- that it had concluded. The ACLU expressed concern in December about the length of the probe. Dolamore responded to that letter in a letter of her own on March 14. She said that she also thought the investigation had taken too long and wrote that five employees had been investigated. Three had been cleared of any violations, but two were found to have committed minor violations of library policy, according to Dolamore's letter.\nCritics of BOLT have said that those investigated were some of the whistleblowers who revealed that the library, under former director Jeff Scott, was more aggressively tossing books than he admitted publicly. (He originally said around 2,200 books were weeded; the final number was around 39,000). They said the ambiguous nature of the investigation, the tone of the attorney who questioned the staff, and the length of the investigation helped create an atmosphere of fear at the library. Numerous staffers appeared at a BOLT meeting to ask the board to intervene and stop targeting the so-called whistleblowers. But that was not something the board could do, said Novosel.\n\"We can't enter into personnel matters,\" he said. \"The City Attorney told me that.\"\nBOLT's inability, or reluctance, to step into the issue angered many library staff.\nThe fact that BOLT could not respond to obvious staff dissatisfaction made the public feel \"extremely disrespected,\" said Worthington. That attitude could open the city up to lawsuits, he said.\nOne librarian, who asked not to be named, said there is a small, core group of staffers who seem to complain about everything. Some of them were the targets of the investigation. \"I'm not saying the administration hasn't made errors, particularly in their failure to rein in a certain manager, but the reaction (in the broadest possible picture) far outweighs the errors,\" she said.\nIn the future, this will be the sign at the Tarea Hall Pittman South Branch Library. Photo: City of BerkeleyRenaming the South Branch\nIn 2014, Charles Austin, a South Berkeley resident, suggested to BOLT that the South Branch be renamed in honor of Pittman, a long-time resident, radio host and civil-rights leader. BOLT originally denied the request, citing a policy against naming the libraries after people. But after Austin collected 2,000 signatures, and after the City Council passed a measure recommending the branch be renamed, BOLT voted in May 2015 to change the name.\nBOLT formed an ad hoc committee with community members to design a new sign and submitted the plans to Berkeley in February 2016. But no permanent signage has gone up yet on the Martin Luther King Jr. Way side of the library, although there has been a banner with Pittman's name hanging over the entrance on Russell. A number of community activists believe the delay shows a lack of respect for Berkeley's African American community. They have also been frustrated by BOLT's silence about what is going on. \"That's a very long time and there has been no communication (about it),\" said Gregory Daniel, who has been working with Austin to get the sign put up. Communication improved 100% after Dolamore started in September, said Daniel. She had two meetings with community members in two weeks, he said, and explained the city delay. But people are still frustrated by the absence of the sign.\nNovosel said the hold-up is not reluctance on the part of BOLT to honor Pittman, but rather city law. The proposed signage did not comply with Berkeley's sign ordinance for neighborhoods zoned R-2, so it was rejected, he said.\nAustin said Novosel, who is an architect and a planning commissioner, should have realized the proposed sign did not conform with the law and taken pre-emptive action to make sure the city issued a variance. \"It's been two years at least since BOLT approved the naming,\" he said. \"He should have known about the regulations and processes about how to get that sign up.... He has been resistant to renaming the library.\"\nIn a bid to remove the roadblocks, Hahn is set to introduce a measure to council March 28 that will amend the Berkeley Municipal Code to allow the library to install a sign on MLK Jr. Way.\nElecting a new president and vice president of BOLT\nWorthington cites issues with electing a new president and vice president of BOLT as one of the reasons Holcomb and Novosel should be removed. In November, BOLT held an election for board officers in which Holcomb was re-elected president and Novosel was re-elected VP. The only other BOLT member present was Winston Burton, as Franklin and then-member Darryl Moore, the former West Berkeley councilman, were absent. The final vote for Holcomb for president was 2 to 1, with Burton voting no. The final vote for Novosel for vice president was 2 to 0 to 1, with Burton abstaining. The city attorney later told BOLT the election was invalid since no candidate received three votes.\nThe next two times BOLT tried to elect a president and VP, in January and February, the process involved a complex set of rules and votes that Worthington says are further proof BOLT does not function well. The votes also resulted in obvious discord between Hahn and Holcomb. In January, Dolamore, acting as secretary, announced BOLT would follow Robert's Rules of Order to elect new leadership. Hahn objected to the way the rules were not announced, nor outlined in the agenda ahead of time. She was particularly concerned that Dolamore's interpretation of the rules meant a \"no\" vote would not be recorded. Instead, whoever got the most votes would be elected by acclamation, said Dolamore.\nHahn was not supportive of Holcomb's nomination and she tried to nominate Franklin, who declined. When Hahn later tried to nominate Burton, Dolamore told her that, under the rules, she could not nominate two people. Hahn was concerned that Dolamore had not informed her of this rule. She tried to withdraw her nomination of Franklin to substitute Burton but was told she could not do that. Hahn said she did not think the process was fair and would walk out if the rules were going to have \"her be considered to have claimed something I am not comfortable with\" (i.e. the vote would record that Holcomb was elected by acclamation and not record Hahn's negative vote). Franklin suggested that the tone in the room had turned negative and suggested the vote be put off. Holcomb agreed to bring it up at a future meeting.\nThe issue came up again in February. Holcomb announced that, according to Robert's Rules of Order, whoever was nominated first and got three votes was elected. If there were multiple nominees, Dolamore had suggested there be a paper ballot. Hahn expressed concern about the idea of electing someone by acclamation. She put forward a substitute motion to have the votes recorded. \"Regardless of how many nominees we have, I would request that each of us be able to have our vote recorded as affirmative, negative or abstaining.\" Hahn's substitute motion failed to pass.\nHahn then left the meeting, saying: \"I need to be out of the room ... you can go on.\"\nNovosel then nominated Holcomb to be BOLT president. Franklin seconded the motion and Holcomb was re-elected 3-0. (Burton was absent.) Novosel was then re-elected vice president.\nHahn later told Berkeleyside she found BOLT uninterested in reaching consensus, and preferred to push through a majority view.\nIn his measure, Worthington said the BOLT board violated the city charter by voting by acclamation instead of recording everyone's votes. The Municipal Code section 3.04 states: \"The Board of Library Trustees, by a majority vote of all its members, as herein provided, to be recorded in the minutes with the ayes and noes at length whenever there is a division.\" BOLT cannot willy-nilly rewrite a law adopted by the voters of Berkeley, he said. And suggesting they use a paper ballot was a proposal to violate state law that mandates a verbal vote. Also, BOLT changed the terms of the voting procedures without notice. He pointed out that, in the November votes, members' ayes and nays were recorded, yet that was not permitted under the Robert's Rules of Orders imposed at the January meeting. Worthington said this inconsistency was troubling and was grounds for removal.\nWho would step up to the BOLT board?\nWorthington's original measure also called for Franklin to resign or be recalled, but he has stepped back from that idea. He now wants her to stay, leaving her and Hahn with three vacancies if Holcomb and Novosel are forced off.\n\"As I looked at the library problems and reviewed the last few meetings, it impressed me that Abigail did not totally go along with the repeated, unannounced rule changes and supported getting clear information before voting,\" said Worthington.\nIn March, BOLT voted 4-0-1, with Hahn abstaining, to recommend Judy Hunt, a former Rent Board commissioner, to fill the seat being vacated by Burton. Worthington says he does not support Hunt's nomination and will not vote for her. He said he no longer believes politicians should sit on BOLT because it \"politicizes\" the board. For this reason, he would not support John Selawsky, a current Rent Board commissioner, either. Selawsky applied for Burton's vacant seat.\nNovosel said Worthington and Arreguin are opposed to Hunt because she ran against a Rent Board slate they supported. On that slate was Alejandro Soto-Vigil, Worthington's former aide, and Arreguin's current aide.\nWorthington is putting forth a measure to appoint Diane Davenport, who worked at the library for 27 years, and Jeff Chang, a middle school librarian, to BOLT. Both applied for Burton's seat. Davenport has been an outspoken critic of recent library policies, including the book weeding.\nAlthough Worthington looks like he has the votes to \"reconstitute\" BOLT, Wengraf believes this is the wrong approach to the problem.\n\"It's feeling very Trumpian to me,\" she said. \"It's slash and burn... a coup d'etat. I don't want to do anything to hurt the library. This seems like a bunch of bad press me. What good is going to come out of all of this? Let's not make the library a political football.\"\nCity Councilwoman Lori Droste also questioned the severity of the path Worthington and others are pursuing. While she believes BOLT stumbled in its initial handling of how Scott responded to the book weeding controversy as well as in getting a new sign for the Tarea Hall Pittman/South Branch Library, those actions could be considered a difference of opinion, she said. There is no evidence of malfeasance or ill will on behalf of BOLT, so why should Holcomb and Novosel be tossed out before their terms expire in 2019? she said.\n\"I don't know if terminating someone over a difference of opinion sets a good precedent,\" said Droste. \"It feels undemocratic to unilaterally dismiss (members) of the board.\"\nWengraf wonders why Worthington hasn't taken a more moderate approach and tried to mediate the problems. Worthington said he has. He said he has reached out numerous times to BOLT and urged the board to stop going after the whistleblowers, to treat the South Berkeley community better, and more. The period after Scott resigned over the book weeding should have been a time of reconciliation. Instead, the opposite has happened, said Worthington.\n\"We have been trying for over two years to fix these problems,\" he said. \"The problems are only getting worse.\"\n\"We reluctantly conclude that a RECONSTITUTION of the board offers Berkeley a fresh start and a chance to resolve the longstanding problems by bringing fresh perspectives of new Board members without emotional defensiveness or intellectual baggage from past battles,\" reads his measure.\n*Editor's note: After this story was published, Hahn contacted Berkeleyside to say it was not her recollection that she stated she unequivocally supported Worthington's measure. \"I don't announce ahead of time how I am going to vote (unless it's something I sponsored, of course),\" Hahn wrote in an email. \"I may have a predisposition, but I go to meetings with an open mind and listen to the public and to my colleagues.\" Berkeleyside has updated the story.\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "Berkeley City Council seems set to oust 2 library board members", "Tags": "['Berkeley Public Library', 'Board of Library Trustees', 'Julie Holcomb', 'Kriss Worthington', 'Sophie Hahn', 'Tarea Hall Pittman']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Library']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley Public Library", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8681512", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "252234", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2706517", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/22/city-council-set-oust-2-library-board-members/", "Author": "Frances Dinkelspiel", "Date": "2017-03-22T11:45:58-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Parks and Waterfront Department public meeting held on March 18, 2017. Photo: Martin Nicolaus\nThe city's Parks and Waterfront Department has had more than two years to fix the Berkeley Pier, one of the city's most beloved facilities. It's done nothing. Now it wants $900,000 of T1 bond money for \"planning\" to make repairs some indefinite time in the future.\nFor the benefit of the Tom Bates Regional Sports Complex, aka the Gilman Fields, the department wants to spend a quarter million dollars of T1 bond money for \"planning for new restroom...[and] storage container.\" Not to actually build a new restroom but for \"planning\" to do it.\nThere is no money in the department's T1 proposal to actually fix the broken tide tubes that connect Aquatic Park to the Bay. There is a quarter million dollars for \"planning\" to fix them, some day.\nThese are just three examples among dozens in the catalogue of proposals that the Parks and Waterfront Department worked hard to sell to the public at the first so-called public hearing on how the T1 bond money should be spent, held at the Frances Albrier Community Center on the morning of Saturday March 18.\nIt was clear from the agenda that the Department had already decided how to spend the bond money, down to the last penny. Questions from the floor were tightly controlled. Independent proposals were barred from the literature table. Judging by the attendance, there was negligible outreach to minority communities. All public input was corralled into small groups controlled by department staff. The term \"public hearing,\" in the Department's dictionary, means that the department speaks and the public does the hearing.\nThe department does not give the impression of having the capacity to actually get projects done. It seems to see itself largely as a dispensary for consultants to do \"planning.\" No less than $4.35 million of the Department's proposed T1 expenditures unveiled at the hearing go for \"planning\" to be done by outside consultants.\nIn my opinion, you do not need to pay a consultant a quarter of a million dollars to plan a restroom and a storage building at the Gilman fields. That money is enough to build the projects several times over. You do not need to spend another quarter of a million dollars figuring out that the Aquatic Park tubes need repair. A competent contractor could probably replace the tubes for half that amount. The department's numbers are a catalogue of do-nothing budget bloat.\nBerkeley has a new progressive City Council majority. But the Parks and Waterfront administration that grew up under 16 years of the old administration remains entrenched. Its signature achievement was the Tom Bates Regional Sports Complex. That's a very good thing. But meanwhile practically all the rest of Berkeley's parks, including the pier, fell into disrepair.\nThe city's new progressive majority faces many challenges in tackling the messes left by the old administration. As the initial hearing on the T1 bond money demonstrated, one of those challenges is updating the departmental administrations. Parks and Waterfront, for one, needs a thorough shaking up. Unless that is done, the T1 bond money will be a case of pouring new wine into cracked old bottles.\nCorrection: Due to an error by Berkeleyside an earlier version of this opinion piece referred to the Parks and Recreation Department as the Parks and Recreation Commission.

Photo: FrameworksThe housing crisis in the Bay Area has spurred many accusations of NIMBYism --the tendency to say \"Not in My Backyard\" when new housing is proposed.\nThe Berkeley City Council voted last week to make it easier to literally build housing in one's backyard. Berkeley's ordinance on accessory dwelling units (ADUs) -- granny flats, in-law units or cottages, in layman's terms -- is now up to state code and more lenient than it used to be.\nNew state ADU laws went into effect in January, nullifying all local ordinances that did not meet the new standards. While Berkeley already made it much easier to build ADUs in 2015, the city was still more restrictive than the new California law allows.\nADUs are \"a really affordable option for increasing density in our residential neighborhoods,\" said Mayor Jesse Arreguin at the March 14 City Council meeting. \"And I think these amendments, which are making it conform to state law, will go a long way to making it easier for people to construct ADUs in the city.\"\n\nThe state law prohibits parking requirements for ADUs if they are located half a mile from public transit. All Berkeley lots fit that description. Berkeley's former rules were only a bit stricter, requiring parking unless the lot was half a mile from BART or a quarter mile from other transit. Berkeley will also have to be more flexible when determining what replacement parking is required if an ADU gets rid of an existing parking space.\nThe state law also says cities cannot require new utility connections or related fees for secondary connections. Fire sprinklers cannot be required if the primary unit does not require them either. The city previously required new, costly sewer connections for some ADUs.\nAlso among the tweaks to Berkeley's ordinance: matching the minimum size requirement to the state's, and creating different standards for ADUs depending on whether they are connected to the primary building or not, so there are fewer restrictions on attached units.\nCouncilwoman Lori Droste said she thinks the changes to Berkeley's ordinance will make the difference for many residents contemplating whether or not to build an ADU.\n\"I heard a lot of complaints from people around these minor hurdles they were encountering,\" she said.\nThe City Council already lifted a major hurdle in March 2015 when it allowed by-right construction of ADUs so property owners could add their accessory units without obtaining an administrative use permit. The same law relaxed parking, lot size, and other zoning requirements. A 2011 study by Karen Chapple, a UC Berkeley professor and Berkeley planning commissioner, found that nearly 2,000 Berkeley lots would be eligible for ADUs if zoning changes were made.\nProponents of ADUs say they can offer older residents the ability to age in place, provide some relief to parents and adult children alike when kids move back after college, or bring in rental income.\nShawn Rowles, a real estate agent who owns a home in West Berkeley, is in the process of constructing an ADU he plans to rent out.\nADUs will allow some small homeowners and not only large landlords to make some profit, he said.\nCouncilmembers who are often on opposite sides of divisive housing issues spoke in support of ADUs, which escape some, but not all, of the controversy.\n\"These are not big-box. These are intimate units,\" said Councilman Ben Bartlett, who said his sister lives in an ADU.\n\"In a community where adding new buildings is difficult and controversial,\" ADUs offer an alternative, said Denise Pinkston, vice-chair of Berkeley's Zoning Adjustments Board, who helped write one of the new state laws.\nHowever, some say cottages and other extra units make tight parking even tighter or might lead to changes in a neighborhood's character without input from residents not building ADUs. And there is concern that ADUs are prime candidates for short-term rental, taking much-needed housing off the market.\nIn February the City Council passed a short-term rental ordinance, making new ADUs ineligible for short-term rental. Under the ordinance it is legal to rent existing ADUs for fewer than 10 days if they have not been used for long-term rental in the past 10 years. There are currently some Berkeley ADUs listed on websites like Airbnb.\n\"I didn't vote for adding ADUs thinking they would be hotel rooms,\" said Councilwoman Linda Maio in 2016, when the council was considering short-term rental laws.\nThe new amendments cap a years-long process of making it legal and more feasible to create ADUs in Berkeley.\n\"It's been a long road,\" Droste said.\nCorrection: This article was updated on March 21 with a correction relating to short-term rental laws. It previously stated that it is illegal to rent use any ADU for short-term rental. \n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "New laws make it even easier to build backyard cottages in Berkeley", "Tags": "['Berkeley real estate', 'Housing in Berkeley']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Real Estate']", "Natural Language Location": "Virginia Street", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8754822", "Zip Code": "94702", "ID": "251930", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2825632", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/20/new-laws-make-even-easier-build-backyard-cottages-berkeley/", "Author": "Natalie Orenstein", "Date": "2017-03-20T10:23:03-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "This week Berkeley City Council voted to be the first city in the nation to \"divest\" from businesses involved in the construction of President Trump's proposed border wall with Mexico.

Photo: Chris Walker/screenshot from proposalA tent-cabin village and a pet-friendly shelter are both included in an elaborate new proposal to address the growing homeless population in Berkeley. Mayor Jesse Arreguin and Councilwoman Sophie Hahn unveiled the proposal, set to go before the council on April 4, at a press conference Thursday morning.\nTheir Pathways Program would direct city staff to spend the rest of the year coming up with a large-scale, long-term plan to house and serve the city's homeless. In the interim, it would establish a series of temporary housing options and supportive services to immediately assist the chronically homeless.\n\"The homeless crisis is our most pressing emergency,\" Hahn said. The new councilwoman said her conversations on the campaign trail led her to believe \"this is a uniquely opportune time to seize the moment and capture the goodwill of the entire community of Berkeley.\"\nRead Berkeleyside's award-winning coverage of homelessness in Berkeley.And many members of the community -- along with their goodwill and bank accounts -- would be tapped to carry out the massive local and regional collaboration described in the proposal, which is co-sponsored by Councilman Kriss Worthington and Councilwoman Linda Maio.\n\nIf the plan is passed next month, the first order of business would be the creation of a \"low-barrier,\" short-term shelter, based on San Francisco's Navigation Center model. The Center for Stability, Navigation and Respite, or the STAIR Center, would be light on restrictions. Individuals, who could stay at the STAIR Center for up two months, would be permitted to bring pets and store their belongings at the site. Some of Berkeley's homeless residents cite lack of storage space as a deterrent from staying at shelters, where they say theft is common.\nRenderings of the STAIR Center in the proposal show rows of tent cabins with shared outhouses, but the design and details could change significantly, Arreguin said. He said the center is likely to have 50-80 beds. The goal, Arreguin said, is to get it up and running within six months after the plan passes, although no city sites have yet been identified for where it might go.\nThe STAIR Center is meant to remove unnecessary hurdles \"to get people off the streets and into temporary living situations, with the goal of ultimately getting them into permanent housing,\" Arreguin said.\nIn order to identify individuals suited for the center, service workers would \"move in\" to an existing Berkeley homeless encampment for several weeks, bringing outhouses, collecting garbage and providing information on available facilities and services. They would work on building relationships with those living in the encampments, who could opt in to relocating to the STAIR Center. At the end of this outreach period, the city would enforce anti-encampment laws, Arreguin said.\nThe proposed models for outreach and shelter draw heavily from programs implemented in San Francisco. At the city's Navigation Centers, lauded for their ability to connect with the hard-to-reach, individuals can come and go at will, bring partners, pets and belongings, and make use of a range of social services on site. Outreach workers engage in intensive recruitment efforts at encampments in San Francisco too.\nHahn said the approach could disprove the idea that many homeless individuals do not want help.\n\"What does service-resistant mean?\" Hahn said at Thursday's press conference. \"Does that mean that one day an outreach worker approached someone at 8 p.m. and said, 'We have a shelter bed for you,' and they looked at their stuff and their pet and what part of town they were in at that moment...and they were deemed to be service-resistant? I think these much more robust intake models are a better offer.\"\nMayor Jesse Arreguin and Councilwoman Sophie Hahn present their proposal Thursday March 16. Photo: Natalie OrensteinThe proposal lays out a couple of \"exit\" options following a stay at the STAIR Center. For those with family or friends able to provide housing, the city would facilitate reunions through a program like Homeward Bound.\nOthers could qualify for a spot in a potential new village of tiny homes, called the Bridge Living Community. (No relation to BRIDGE Housing, the organization that has signed on to build a homeless service center and apartments on Berkeley Way.) Initial renderings depict rows of tent cabins with front porches, communal outdoor seating and storage facilities. There would also be a shared kitchen, according to the proposal. Residents would have \"some communal responsibilities, and opportunities to engage in activities such as gardening, taking classes, obtaining job training and placement, and connecting with mentors,\" the proposal says. A social service agency would manage the complex and residents would be allowed to stay for up to four months.\nRendering of the BRIDGE Living Community, where residents would stay for up to four months. Photo: Chris Walker/screenshot from proposalIf the plan is passed, city staff will have to hash out the specifics of each element of the project -- most significantly the location for two new temporary housing complexes in a city where available land is scarce. The city recently evaluated 119 publicly owned parcels with homeless housing in mind and narrowed the ones that looked promising to six, only two of which met all the necessary criteria.\nThe temporary housing options are meant to provide immediate refuge for some while the city develops a long-term solution to homelessness. The proposal envisions the so-called \"1000 Person Plan\" -- named after an estimated 1,000 homeless people in Berkeley -- as a complex collaboration between city agencies, the county, homeless service providers, police, the private sector and UC Berkeley.\nBut the proposal gives little direction to city staff, simply instructing them to create a \"comprehensive, innovative and meaningful 1000 Person Plan\" to be presented to the council at the end of 2017, for implementation in 2018. Arreguin said the plan would couple \"rapid rehousing\" measures like rental assistance and eviction protection resources with new permanent housing and programs.\nAnd the proposal would require a tremendous fundraising effort.\n\"We have every expectation that this is going to require new funding,\" possibly including new bonds and other new funding requiring voter approval in 2018, Hahn said.\nThe city might need to create a new nonprofit or work with an existing organization to oversee fundraising and volunteers, the proposal says. Other proposed funding sources include private and corporate donations, and a \"fund-a-structure\" model where individuals and groups sign up to fundraise for specific elements of the plan.\nSome philanthropic donors have already expressed interest in supporting the project to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars, Hahn said.\nIf enacted, the Pathways Program would make good on Arreguin's campaign promises to prioritize homelessness. In June 2016, the then-councilman told Berkeleyside: \"Taking a step back and looking at the big picture and developing a comprehensive plan is really needed.\"\nMike Zint, of First They Came for the Homeless, sits in a tent on the lawn at City Hall after an encampment was removed from the steps, in Berkeley, on Monday, Nov. 7, 2016. Photo: David Yee (c)2016Berkeley's homeless population, which is somewhere between 800 and 1,200 people according to different estimates, is growing, exacerbated by the rental housing crisis. Arreguin and Hahn's proposal assumes a large portion of Berkeley's homeless population was formerly housed, citing a recent study finding that to be the case in San Francisco. (See Berkeleyside's homelessness fact sheet.)\nThe Pathways Program would be the latest, though by far the most ambitious, in a string of efforts to reduce homelessness in Berkeley.\nIn January 2016 the city opened a one-stop-shop intake center in South Berkeley. The Hub is a central point of entry into the city's disparate services and shelter options, and manages the first coordinated effort to collect data on homelessness.\nIn December the city launched an \"emergency operations center\" and new West Berkeley shelter with storage space and dog kennels, in an effort to ramp up resources during an unusually rainy winter. Last month the council also voted to explore the creation of micro-homes, built by a private developer on public land.\nThe new program would not replace any existing shelters or services, but hopefully help them work in concert more effectively, Arreguin said.\nThe city has drawn criticism in the past for moves some say criminalize the homeless. In 2012 a ballot measure that would have fully banned sitting on sidewalks in commercial districts during the day and evening failed. In 2015 the city council made it harder to camp out on the sidewalk during the day by restricting how much space a person could occupy. The new city council made some tweaks to that law.\nIn recent months, one group of homeless people protesting some of Berkeley's homelessness policies has been involved in a protracted struggle with the city. The \"First They Came for the Homeless\" camp has roved around Berkeley, relocating each time the city disbands it. It is currently set up on Adeline Street, at the Berkeley-Oakland border.\nEnforcing encampment laws is expensive, Arreguin said. And according to the city, Berkeley currently provides $3.6 million a year to community organizations providing homelessness services.\nThe mayor said Thursday that the Pathways Program is his and Hahn's attempt to implement a preventative, \"housing-first\" approach instead of relying on a cycle of emergency services.\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "Ambitious proposal seeks to shake up the way Berkeley handles homelessness", "Tags": "['Berkeley homelessness', 'Emergency Operations Center', 'Jesse Arreguin', 'SF Homeless Project', 'Sophie Hahn']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Community']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley City Council", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8694486", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "251752", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2730616", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/16/ambitious-proposal-seeks-shake-way-berkeley-handles-homelessness/", "Author": "Natalie Orenstein", "Date": "2017-03-16T16:00:44-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "The T1 bond will bring $100 million into the city to help with infrastructure projects.

Proposed upgrades include seismic work, and energy and water efficiency improvements, as well as \"operational upgrades.\"\nBut those staff recommendations are just a starting point, he said: The city wants to hear from the community about what it wants the money to be used for.\nTo aid in that process, the city has, for the first time, created what it's calling a \"story map\" where community members can view three different datasets to get a complete picture of what the city is doing as far as infrastructure: the staff recommendations for Measure T1 projects; projects funded through fiscal year 2017; and proposed projects from July 2017 through June 2019. The map includes basic information about each project, along with its projected cost. The city hopes local residents will use the information and maps to guide their input going forward.\n(Though the projects are listed by number, those numbers do not indicate any sort of ranking or priority, the city said.)\nRead more about Measure T1 on the city website.The bond will provide important financial support to Berkeley, which has over $500 million in unfunded infrastructure needs: \"a significant problem that results in deferred maintenance and disrepair in existing infrastructure and buildings,\" according to the prepared statement. \"The November bond measure will help address some of the unfunded need.\"\nIn 2017-18, the city has budgeted about $23.5 million for capital improvements and maintenance, which includes recurring capital improvement and maintenance funds for parks, city facilities, sewers, storm drains, sidewalks, and streets. (This does not include T1 money.)\nStaff and commissioners are set to make its T1 spending recommendations to the Berkeley City Council in June for the upcoming fiscal year. There will be additional public engagement opportunities for future phases of the project, the city says.\nMeeting details and further information\nAll workshops, which have been organized by city staff, the Public Works Commission and the Parks & Recreation Commission, will be wheelchair-accessible. Community members can also provide feedback to the city by email. Mid-April is the recommended deadline, though no official deadline has been set.\nWorkshop #1, parks and general City facilities: Saturday, March 18, 10 a.m. to noon, Frances Albrier Community Center, 2800 Park St.\nWorkshop #2, streets and storm water infrastructure: Saturday, March 25, noon to 2 p.m., Live Oak Community Center, 1301 Shattuck Ave.\nWorkshop #3, additional input on staff recommendations, summarizing input gathered to date:  Saturday, April 8, 10 a.m. to noon, Tarea Hall Pittman South Branch Library, 1910 Russell St.\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "Berkeley infrastructure workshops kick off Saturday", "Tags": "['Berkeley city budget', 'Berkeley elections', 'Berkeley parks', 'Election 2016 Berkeley', 'Measure T1']", "Sections": "['2016 Election', '2016 Election', 'City', 'Politics']", "Natural Language Location": "North Berkeley Senior Center", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8736888", "Zip Code": "94709", "ID": "251614", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2749998", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/15/berkeley-infrastructure-workshops-kick-off-saturday/", "Author": "Emilie Raguso", "Date": "2017-03-15T16:12:30-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Photo: Courtesy of Kate HarrisonKate Harrison is being sworn in as Berkeley's newest City Council member Wednesday at 3 p.m. Berkeleyside will be at City Hall and will, all things going well, broadcasting it live on Facebook.

Photo: Natalie OrensteinUpdate: Wells Fargo spokesman Ruben Pulido emailed the following response at 4:39 p.m. on March 14:\n\n\"Wells Fargo is just one of 17 financial institutions that financed the Dakota Access Pipeline; the loan we made represents less than 5 percent of the total. As a company committed to human rights and environmental sustainability, we respect all the differing opinions being expressed regarding this project.\n\nWe greatly value the business relationship we have with the City of Berkeley and are proud of how we support its citizens. From 2013-2015 in Berkeley, Wells Fargo approved 264 home loans totaling $167 million so people could achieve their dreams of homeownership, approved 2,300 small business loans for $112 million so entrepreneurs could grow the local economy, and philanthropically invested more than $3 million in Berkeley schools and nonprofits. We stand ready to continue to work with the city, and remain committed to strengthening the local community.\"\n\nOriginal story: At its meeting tonight, the Berkeley City Council will consider the implications of severing ties with Wells Fargo, the megabank that has been ensnarled in controversy over both its business practices and investment in the Dakota Access Pipeline.\nA Finance Department report on the agenda tonight says it is \"necessary\" for the city to continue banking with Wells Fargo for the next three years as staff consider other options, but suggests individual services that could be switched over to another provider in the meantime.\nIn January, the council voted to consider \"social responsibility\" -- or lack thereof -- as it selects its next banking contracts. Some council members said Wells Fargo's investment in Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the Dakota Access Pipeline, and its fake account scandal, call its ethics into question.\nThe current four-year contract with Wells Fargo, which the city has used since 2004, ends in May. The city has the option of extending the contract for three years twice.\n\nSome members of the council will meet Friday with a Wells Fargo representative \"to find out their side of the story because they've never been at the table,\" said Councilwoman Susan Wengraf, who co-sponsored the proposal to include ethics in the banking selection criteria.\n\"We'll make it clear to him that this is a huge account,\" she said. \"And even though they are an important player in our community - they are philanthropic, and they do give money - the fact is they have to be accountable for what they do nationwide as well.\" \nThe Finance Department report says it could take up to two or three years to select and fully transition to a new bank. The city is also in the process of switching over to a new electronic financial management system, which would further complicate the process, the report says.\nBut the report identifies specific Wells Fargo contracts the city could potentially drop this year, including a $445,000 merchant service fees contract and a $1.5 million armored car service contract. The value of the city's total 10-year contract with Wells Fargo is $10,356,000.\nThis is not the first time Berkeley has considered abandoning Wells Fargo. In 2012, the city considered switching in light of Wells Fargo's role in the subprime mortgage crisis, but ultimately stuck with the bank.\n\"I think that the pipeline issue has reenergized the issue,\" Wengraf said. \"And I think the fact that other cities and agencies have already done it is pushing us forward.\" \nSeattle was first to end its relationship with the bank in the current storm over Wells Fargo. Closer to home, Alameda has begun divesting as well.\nThe Finance Department report says the incremental approach to pulling out of certain Wells Fargo contracts has local precedence. UC Berkeley recently ended some of its contracts with Wells Fargo, cutting the overall value in half.\nAlso on the City Council agenda tonight: a vote to add a non-voting UC Berkeley student to the council dais, and to adopt a new ordinance allowing tenants to take civil action against harassment. The consent calendar includes an amendment to the city code requiring advance notice and public hearings prior to the closing of a health facility. (The proposed closure of Alta Bates Hospital is facing significant pushback from both local politicians and community members.) Early steps toward allowing undocumented residents to vote in city elections, and the initiation of a process to consider the reopening of Willard Pool are also on the consent calendar. See the full agenda.\nBefore the regular meeting at 7 p.m., council will hold a special meeting at 5:30 p.m. with two items on the agenda: a new debt management and disclosure policy (required by Senate Bill 1029, signed by Governor Jerry Brown in September) and the latest annual crime report from the Berkeley Police Department.

Photo: Courtesy of Kate HarrisonKate Harrison will be sworn in as Berkeley's newest City Council member Wednesday at 3 p.m. at City Hall, further cementing the city's new progressive majority.\nHarrison, 58, handily beat Ben Gould, 25, a UC Berkeley graduate student, who had also run for mayor in 2016, by capturing 62% of the vote. Gould got 38%. The Alameda County registrar of voters certified those results this week.\nVoter turnout for the District 4 mail-in election was about 28% and Harrison said the fact that UC Berkeley students were in the middle of midterms the last few weeks might have contributed to the low numbers.\n\"It was a particularly bad time for students,\" she said. Of the district's 9,453 registered voters, 2,620 cast ballots, according to the election officials.\n\nLearn more about Berkeley's newest Council member.Harrison said, when she knocked on doors to talk to voters, many mentioned their concerns about President Trump and his pledge to cut money for sanctuary cities, housing and schools, as well as other matters. People were turned off by the national election, which may also have contributed to the low turnout, she speculated.\nVoters also have a number of local issues that concern them, such as the high cost of housing, said Harrison. As the representative of the downtown area abutting UC Berkeley, she plans to make the question of student housing one of her priorities.\nHarrison's election means the Berkeley City Council has an even greater progressive majority than after the November 2016 election. Mayor Jesse Arreguin, who held the District 4 seat before Harrison, defeated former Councilman Laurie Capitelli, who had been endorsed by former Mayor Tom Bates. Cheryl Davila defeated Councilman Darryl Moore, a moderate, while Ben Bartlett won the seat of retiring Max Anderson, and Sophie Hahn won Capitelli's former seat.\nSo the council swung from Bates' 6-3 majority of moderates to Arreguin's 6-3 majority of progressives.\nHarrison raised more than $44,000 for her campaign, nearly tripling what Gould raised. One of her biggest donors was Berkeley Working Families for Harrison, which is funded by SEIU Local 1021, a union that represents local governments, nonprofit agencies, healthcare programs and schools. That group donated $11,500 to Harrison's campaign, according to city campaign finance records.\nOther donors included those active in Berkeley's progressive political wing, including Michael and Becky O'Malley, Austene Hall, Kelly Hammargren, Daniel Knapp, Gene Poschman, Carrie Olson, James McFadden, Toni Mester, Gale Garcia, Zelda Bronstein, George Beier, and others, according to campaign reports.\nMayor Arreguin, Bartlett, and Hahn also donated, as did Jacquelyn McCormick, who works as an aide to Arreguin. Former San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, for whom Harrison once worked, also contributed, as did former San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt. Paola Laverde-Levine, who sits on the Rent Board, was also a donor, as was Sheila Jordan, the former superintendent of schools for Alameda County.\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "Kate Harrison to be sworn in Wednesday as new Berkeley City Council member", "Tags": "['Ben Gould', 'Berkeley City Council', 'Berkeley City Council election', 'Downtown Berkeley', 'Kate Harrison']", "Sections": "['2016 Election', '2016 Election', 'City', 'Downtown', 'Politics']", "Natural Language Location": "District 4", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8694486", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "251329", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2730616", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/14/kate-harrison-sworn-wednesday-new-berkeley-city-council-member/", "Author": "Frances Dinkelspiel", "Date": "2017-03-14T09:00:08-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Many neighbors held signs to ask council Tuesday night to \"House our diverse community.\" Photo: Emilie RagusoIn a bizarre twist both sides said was unforeseen, a deal more than a year in the making stalled out Tuesday night prior to a City Council vote that had been expected to bring 50 new housing units to South Berkeley.\nIt was a night of multiple revelations. First, neighbors who had appealed a zoning board permit for a new building at 2902 Adeline St. announced they had reached an agreement with developer Realtex just an hour before the meeting. But by the time the night was done, the strength of that compromise seemed shaky at best, as council put off its vote until April 4 at the developer's request. And no one seems to know what will happen next.\nThroughout the night, the meeting room was crowded with neighbors who reluctantly had come around after opposing the project in earlier iterations, as well as advocates -- including some neighborhood residents -- for increasing Berkeley's housing stock as quickly as possible.\nFor nearly two hours, it seemed most everyone was in agreement in asking council to approve the project, though the reasons varied. Appellants and their supporters said they wanted the compromise to move ahead, and wanted more housing in the neighborhood. The \"yes-in-my-back-yard,\" or YIMBY, crowd, said projects on transit lines in urban areas -- such as 2902 Adeline -- must be built now to ease the housing crunch for everyone. But then, as Councilman Ben Bartlett read out the terms of the deal, which he was key in brokering, there came a sticking point about exactly how many units of below-market-rate housing would be built on site.\n\nBoth sides said the developer agreed to include 20% affordable housing. But the appellants said that meant 10 units, while Realtex said the city code requires just eight, because the 20% calculation is based on the project's 42 market-rate units rather than the overall 50. (Berkeleyside has requested clarification from the city about how to understand the code, but had not heard back before publication time.)\nNeighborhood residents who had appealed the project, as well as the East Bay Community Law Center, which has represented that group in negotiations, said they believed there would be five units for people making 50% of the area median income, and five more for people making 80% of it. In fact, noted Councilman Kriss Worthington, 80% of all those units would go to people with Section 8 vouchers, who make much less than either percentage, as per city policy.\nCity staff said council could deny at least one aspect of the project, but the city attorney said the issue was \"a little more complicated.\" Photo: Emilie RagusoNot under dispute: Both sides said Realtex agreed to a payment of $100,000 to help create a position at the Law Center to help fight displacement, which is another Bartlett initiative (along with Mayor Jesse Arreguin and Councilwoman Cheryl Davila) set to come before council later this month. Realtex also said it would meet monthly with neighbors during construction to make sure it's going well.\n\"No matter what happens with the vote, Ben Bartlett is a hero for coming up with that idea and getting the people on all sides to think that that's a great step forward,\" said Worthington, after the confusion arose but before it was clear how the night would end. He called the compromise \"an incredible, innovative policy initiative.\"\nRealtex had previously planned to build just four below-market-rate units, and then pay an $884,000 fee to the city that would be used to build additional units elsewhere in the future. The neighbors have been pushing for 30% affordable units on site, as well as community benefits.\nCody Fornari, of Realtex, addresses council. Photo: Emilie RagusoRealtex rep Cody Fornari told council Tuesday that Realtex is willing to build four units at 50% and four at 80% of the area median income (AMI), and to pay $68,000 into the city's Housing Trust Fund to comply with the code. Alternatively, he said, Realtex could include a ninth unit in the project -- and pay no fee -- but he said it would have to be available at 80% rather than 50% AMI. But council wasn't having it.\n\"I'd like to just hold my ground and say 10 units on site,\" said Bartlett, who attended the meeting by phone. \"I'm kind of surprised ... that we're even discussing this right now.\"\nFornari told council he was surprised, too. And, when it became clear neither side would budge, Fornari asked officials to postpone the rest of the meeting to a later date. His request was met with hissing and booing from many in the crowd.\nCouncilwoman Lori Droste said, in her remarks, she would have liked to have approved the project Tuesday night had there been \"true compromise.\" She said she was \"incredibly frustrated\" with how the meeting had turned out, and that the city needs to find a way to maximize affordability while retaining economic feasibility, and help projects get through the pipeline faster.\n\"We're all affected by the housing crisis,\" Droste said. \"We all agree it's a huge problem, and we need to do something.\"\nIn her motion to push the meeting to April, Councilwoman Linda Maio said there are technical issues that need a deeper look, and that the delay could give Bartlett and potentially Mayor Arreguin a chance to meet with Realtex to continue the negotiation. She said it would also give the city time to \"explore our various options legally.\"\nOne legal issue of concern relates to a zoning modification called a concession, which is tied to the use permit that allowed 2902 Adeline to add its fifth and sixth stories, even though that meant the project would exceed the district's allowable \"floor area ratio,\" or how its total floor area compares to the overall lot size. A city planner told council it would be within its rights to deny that concession, due to a new state law, which would result in a 4-story building.\nBut City Attorney Zach Cowan told council the issue is \"a little more complicated\" because the burden is on the city to justify the denial, and because the legal basis for the denial was left intentionally vague in the state code. As of January, state law says concessions can be denied if they do not result in cost reductions to provide for affordable housing costs. But Cowan said there is no guidance about what that actually means.\nA bird's eye view of 2902 Adeline looking south from Milvia and Russell. Image: Trachtenberg ArchitectsProject architect David Trachtenberg told council he thought the city could also be more flexible in its thinking about the floor area ratio, noting that, over the whole project site, which includes a residential lot bought by developers for $1 million to help create a buffer between nearby single-family homes and the proposed 6-story building, the floor area ratio actually comes in below the commercial district limit. He said he had kept the denser massing on Adeline, away from those neighbors, and thought council could \"be reasonable\" and take that into consideration.\nAccording to the staff report for Tuesday's meeting, the proposed building would reach 6 stories, or about 65 feet, in the commercial zone on Adeline, then \"step down\" to 5 stories (about 55 feet) closer to the residential zone, and drop to 1 story, or 18 feet, on the west side of the building.\nPlanning staff said after the meeting that the floor area ratio only applies to the commercial district and cannot technically, under the zoning code, be calculated as per Trachtenberg's suggestion.\nProject architect David Trachtenberg urged council to \"be reasonable\" in its decision about the project, noting that the developer spent $1 million to help create a buffer between the 6-story building and nearby single-family homes. Photo: Emilie RagusoShock, confusion after meeting\nWednesday, Berkeleyside tried to zero in on exactly what led to the breakdown Tuesday night. But no coherent narrative emerged.\nSee the proposed dealFornari said he was perplexed by the turn of events before council because the draft version of the deal the Law Center sent him shortly before the meeting says 20% of the project's market-rate units would be for below-market-rate households, as per his understanding of city code. By his calculation, that means 42 market-rate units and eight units below market rate, to get to the 50 total units.\nFornari said he and Bartlett \"specifically talked numbers,\" noting: \"It was eight units.\"\n\"That's exactly what we agreed to. That's exactly what I am still willing to do. When 10 units was put forward that was a very big surprise to me,\" he said. \"It's very unfortunate. And I'm deeply saddened that ... it obviously looks like I went back on a deal that was made. I really don't feel that's what happened.\"\nIncluding too many units below market rate, Fornari said, makes a project economically infeasible, which means no bank will finance it. He said he now plans to continue talks, but said the delays may impact project plans and drive up costs.\n\"It only pushes both sides further apart,\" Fornari said. \"I was very excited to come in with what I thought was the understanding of all parties, and very disappointed to walk out with a lot of trust of the community lost.\"\nA rendering of the proposed view of 2902 Adeline, looking southwest from Adeline and Russell streets. Image: Trachtenberg ArchitectsBartlett said Wednesday he hopes Realtex will take some time to reevaluate its position. He said he wasn't sure if there had been a miscommunication, a misunderstanding, or something else, and described the issue as one of \"murky numbers.\"\n\"I never heard any qualifications of 20%,\" he said.\n\"This has been the result of 13 months of negotiations and ... multiple channels of dialogue,\" Bartlett said. \"The concessions which were presented by the applicant were the ones I read to the dais. So we were a bit taken aback by the reversal by the applicant. Needless to say: We were displeased.\"\nBartlett said he has been working to create a three-pronged model to fight displacement through \"equitable development\" in South Berkeley that would create diverse populations within any given building; help fight displacement through the advocacy position at the Law Center; and build \"pipelines for employment\" by making sure construction jobs stay local. A \"community benefits overlay\" is also in the works that would help streamline project approvals for developers who give back.\n\"Those developers that can align themselves with our efforts will prosper,\" he said. \"This is about achieving a true and just end for the people.\"\nNeighbor: \"I'm not even sure anyone's going to agree to the 20% anymore\"\nAbove and below: 2908 Adeline, at Russell Street, where AW Pottery operates. Image: Google MapsAbove and below: 2908 Adeline, at Russell Street, where AW Pottery operates. Image: Google MapsJanis Ching, who addressed council Tuesday night on behalf of the 30 or so signatories of the appeal, said the main feeling as the meeting wore on was shock.\n\"When the whole thing started to unravel, it was like: What just happened? You offered us this, we went through all of this work to get people to do this, and then you say, 'Oh no, it's eight units,'\" said the 15-year South Berkeley resident. \"And that's still where we are.\"\nShe said neighbors -- who are working under the umbrella of Friends of Adeline, though not all of them are members of that group -- had tried since last summer to get Realtex to the negotiating table. But the company never agreed to sit down until Monday, following a community meeting last week where neighbors had continued to fight for 30% affordable housing on site.\nMonday, Ching said, Realtex suddenly offered the group 20% affordable housing if it would drop its appeal and agree not to fight the project in court.\nIntensive phone-banking then happened, she said, to get all 30 appellants to agree. And it wasn't easy. Many had balked at the deal, but ultimately decided it was the best one they would get, particularly because Realtex had said it needed to move fast.\nChing said she always understood the 20% number to be based on the 50 units of the project overall: \"What alternative math universe are they living in that 20% of 50 is eight?\"\nShe said she didn't know whether Realtex had negotiated in bad faith or not, but said it definitely felt like the company had \"pulled the rug out\" during the meeting, which led to a lot of anger and ill will. She said the neighborhood wants to see the project built, and wants the additional housing for South Berkeley. But she doesn't know where to go from here.\n\"I'm not even sure anyone's going to agree to the 20% anymore,\" Ching said. \"Everybody's asking when we're going to meet again. And everybody else is like, 'Oh, I'm so tired.'\"\nAttorney for appellants: \"It's certainly not just a misunderstanding\"\nOver at the East Bay Community Law Center, attorney Jassmin Poyaoan agreed: \"I feel that people just feel deceived, and rightfully so. It's a very hard pill for a lot of people to swallow to come back to the table after what happened last night.\"\nShe said Wednesday she believes the 20% calculation should be done on all 50 units -- her understanding of city code -- and said, in a letter to the city, Law Center attorneys \"reiterated ... many times that building 20% onsite meant building 20% of the 50 units.\"\nShe said shifting figures had come up in negotiation talks with Realtex before.\n\"They have switched up numbers on us throughout this whole time we have been dealing with them, almost over a year,\" Poyaoan said, adding that Realtex had talked previously about building four or six affordable units on site. She said, also, Realtex had talked in negotiations about paying no fee to the city's Housing Trust Fund -- which would have required at least nine units, as per Tuesday night's discussion. Eight units were simply never on the table, she said.\nBut she also said the number of units was \"always discussed in terms of percentages.\" She wrote, in her letter, neighbors are \"shocked and appalled\" by the process over the past 20 months, \"and especially in the last two days.\" She said the community negotiated in good faith after finally getting a seat at the table, and was concerned Realtex may not have done the same.\n\"I don't know what's going on,\" Poyaoan said, \"but I know it's certainly not just a misunderstanding.\"\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "Dispute over details puts 'innovative' deal for new Berkeley housing on hold", "Tags": "['2902 Adeline St.', 'Adeline Corridor', 'Adeline Street', 'Ashby BART', 'Ben Bartlett', 'Berkeley affordable housing', 'Berkeley City Council', 'Berkeley real estate', 'Berkeley urban planning', 'East Bay Community Law Center', 'Housing in Berkeley', 'Realtex', 'South Berkeley', 'Trachtenberg Architects', 'Zoning Adjustments Board']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Real Estate']", "Natural Language Location": "2902 Adeline Street", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.856221", "Zip Code": "94703", "ID": "250871", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2712267", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/09/dispute-details-puts-innovative-deal-new-berkeley-housing-hold/", "Author": "Emilie Raguso", "Date": "2017-03-09T10:30:39-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "A collage of the six photographs of March 4 suspects issued by Berkeley Police Wednesday.

A 1% manual tally, to check the electronic equipment as required by state law, is slated to be done Monday, with certified results expected to follow next week.\nOriginal story, March 7, 8:33 p.m. Early results in the special vote-by-mail election in District 4, to fill the vacant seat once held by Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin, strongly suggest Kate Harrison will be the likely new council member. The early results, just posted by the Alameda County Registrar of Voters, show Harrison leading Ben Gould 1,278 to 728.\nThe early results do not include ballots mailed Monday or today. The registrar has said updated tallies, with ballots from the latest mail-in voters, will be available on Friday.\nHarrison was endorsed by Mayor Jesse Arreguin, had represented District 4 before he won the mayor's seat. Gould, a UC Berkeley graduate student, had run in the November mayor's race, finishing fourth. Harrison's likely victory should cement a majority on many City Council votes for Arreguin and his allies.\n\nHarrison could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday night.\nThere are 9,453 registered voters in the district, so there may be many more votes to count.\nHowever, it is unlikely that late voters will vary dramatically from earlier voters. Harrison's 63.7% to Gould's 36.3% is sufficiently commanding that only anomalous results in the late counts would swing the result.\nOn Tuesday night, Gould said he agreed it was unlikely late votes would alter the result, but that he was pleased with his campaign.\n\"I'm really proud of everything my team achieved,\" he said. \"I'm looking forward to working with my community and making Berkeley a better place. I always said my campaign was about solving problems in Berkeley and my community. I may have to contribute in a different way.\"\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "Early results from District 4 special election suggest Harrison win", "Tags": "['Ben Gould', 'Berkeley City Council election', 'Berkeley elections', 'Berkeley politics', 'District 4', 'Downtown Berkeley', 'Election 2016 Berkeley', 'Kate Harrison']", "Sections": "['2016 Election', '2016 Election', 'City', 'Politics']", "Natural Language Location": "District 4", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8694486", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "250783", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2730616", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/07/early-results-district-4-special-election-suggest-harrison-win/", "Author": "Lance Knobel", "Date": "2017-03-07T20:33:29-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Pro- and anti-Trump demonstrations in Civic Center Park in Berkeley on March 4 produced intermittent scuffles and fights between rival groups. Photo: Daniel McPartlanThe pro- and anti-Trump demonstrations on Saturday in Civic Center Park resulted in 10 arrests and continuing criminal investigations to identify others who were involved in the sporadic violence, according to a report to the City Manager from interim Chief of Police Andrew Greenwood.\nOnly one of the arrestees on Saturday was from Berkeley. The 10 arrests on Saturday connected to the demonstrations were: Dustin Sawtelle, 39, from San Francisco, on suspicion of assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury; a male juvenile, 16, from Berkeley, in connection with battery; a female juvenile, 17, from Concord, on suspicion of battery; Kyle Chapman, 41, from San Francisco, in connection with assault with a deadly weapon (other than firearm), and carrying a concealed dirk or dagger; Jeremy Wilhite, 23, from Fremont, on suspicion of battery; Michael Hornsby, 27, from Riverside, in connection with rioting, battery, warrant -- false identification to peace officers; Jeffrey Armstrong, 32, from Oakland, in connection with assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury; Nathan Perry, 33, from Modesto, on suspicion of assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury; Rackell Anzaldua, 20, from Fremont, in connection with battery; and Nicholaas Molloy, 22, from San Bruno, on suspicion of obstructing or resisting a peace officer.\nAccording to BPD spokesman Sgt. Andrew Frankel, the three assault arrests were on felony charges. The other arrests were misdemeanors.\nGreenwood's three-page report, with an additional four pages of photographs, argues for the success of Berkeley Police's strategy, which largely involved standing on the sidelines for much of the afternoon, closely observing events, tending to some minor injuries, making a handful of arrests, and, as crowds dwindled as dusk approached, intervening more strongly and making further arrests. The report explains BPD's approach, which some of the pro-Trump demonstrators in particular have criticized, both on Saturday and in comments on Berkeleyside's reports.\n\nRobert Clawson, for example, that he thought the police should have come down more strongly on the counter-protesters who attacked Trump supporters: \"Do your job Berkeley police. You cannot pick and choose who you protect,\" he posted on Berkeleyside.\nWeapons and more confiscated \"from both sides\" by the Berkeley Police at the March 4 protest in Berkeley. Photo: BPDIn the report, Greenwood defended the department's strategy, however: \"A fight within a volatile crowd is not a simple matter in which to intervene. Intervening on intermixed groups of armed participants fighting or eager to fight presents challenges. Intervention requires a major commitment of resources, a significant use of force, and carries with it the strong likelihood of harming those who are not committing a crime. Finally, intervention risks escalating an event into a full riot.\"\nIn Greenwood's account, the success of the approach can be judged by the fact that \"no uninvolved community members were injured, and there were no reports of violence or vandalism in the downtown and surrounding areas as a result of the rally or brief march through the downtown area.\"\nGreenwood also details BPD's preparation for Saturday's demonstrations. The police contacted both pro- and anti-Trump sides with mixed results.\n\"Some groups did not respond at all,\" he wrote (he singles out the main anti-Trump group, BAMN, as not responding). \"Others gave inaccurate and inconsistent information regarding their intentions, level of preparedness, and security plans.\"\nThe report also makes clear the dilemma BPD faced with the fluid events of the afternoon.\n\"Fights broke out intermittently between various protesters and counter-protesters throughout the event. These altercations usually took place in the middle of the group, and lasted a few seconds,\" Greenwood wrote. \"Based on the location and duration of the altercations, it was frequently difficult for officers on the ground to identify primary aggressor suspects and victims.\"\nGreenwood goes on to note, \"When a crowd includes armed people intent on committing violence on each other, safeguarding our community becomes a particularly challenging balancing act. Our responsibility in this situation is to act with a clear and level-headed awareness of context, of what actions we're taking and why, and of what effect or reaction our actions may generate. We are rightly expected to not get swept into the volatility of the crowd.\"\nSuch an explanation would not likely satisfy levirizetnikof, who posted in Berkeleyside's comments, \"BPD allowed citizens to be assaulted by fascists, once again. They deserve no praise. If they had actually protected free speech and arrested fascists, this would be a better city. Instead, Berkeley will again be held up as a center of intolerance and repression.\"\nOne of those arrested, Kyle Chapman, who was arrested on suspicion of felony assault with a deadly weapon, has set up a Twitter account to argue that he was \"arrested for being a Patriot.\" Another account describes itself as his \"unofficial public relations agent.\" The incident that led to Chapman's arrest was captured by a tweeter, whose photo is included in Greenwood's report to the city manager, as is an image of him being arrested. Chapman said he was due to be arraigned Tuesday at Wiley Manuel Courthouse in Oakland.\n\n\n#Antifa has met it's match, a man who can LARP harder than them! #Basedstickman pic.twitter.com/pNYa14WTwP\n-- Johnny[?]Medieval (@Johnny_Medieval) March 6, 2017\n\nAccording to Greenwood, \"significant\" criminal investigations are continuing. BPD plans to release photographs in the next few days, seeking the public's help in identifying suspects, as it did after the riots that erupted after the slated appearance of Milo Yiannopoulos in Berkeley on Feb. 1. It has also established a confidential Dropbox for members of the public to upload further photos or videos.\nCity departments other than the police were involved in planning for contingencies on Saturday and the city's emergency operations center was activated for the day, according to city spokesman Matthai Chakko, but he said Monday that BPD was wholly responsible for the tactics used on Saturday.\n\"This was all police -- 100%,\" he said.\nAccording to Chakko, the city does not yet have a tally of the extra costs incurred on Saturday.\n\"We won't have that for a while,\" Chakko said. \"It's a significant cost, there's no doubt.\"\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "Intervention risks escalation': Police explain approach to March 4 demo", "Tags": "['Berkeley crime', 'Berkeley Police', 'Berkeley protests', 'Donald Trump', 'Public safety']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Crime & Safety', 'Downtown', 'Police']", "Natural Language Location": "Civic Center Park", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8693718", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "250667", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.274042", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/07/intervention-risks-escalation-berkeley-police-explain-approach-march-4-demonstration/", "Author": "Lance Knobel", "Date": "2017-03-07T13:00:24-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "A rendering of the proposed view of 2902 Adeline, looking southwest from Adeline and Russell streets. Image: Trachtenberg ArchitectsTuesday night, the Berkeley City Council is holding a special meeting to hear an appeal by local residents fighting a 6-story building in South Berkeley approved in late October.\nSee appeal documents on the city websiteThe city's Zoning Adjustments Board approved the 50-unit building, at 2902 Adeline St., after a lengthy hearing, and an appeal to council was expected. Many neighbors of the project have opposed it since developers presented it to the community in 2015. The item is the only one on Tuesday night's special meeting agenda.\nLocal resident Robert Lauriston filed an appeal Nov. 3 on behalf of himself and 29 other signatories, including many nearby neighbors of 2902 Adeline. Lauriston wrote, in a letter to council dated Feb. 21, that \"the central argument of our appeal is not that the ZAB failed to interpret the law correctly, but that in exercising its discretion it fell well short of the best possible deal for the city.\" He said other decisions made by the zoning board, related to increased project height and lot coverage, and reduced off-street parking, \"were all granted at the ZAB's discretion.\" He said a more robust response to the staff report would be forthcoming.\nThe project includes about 4,100 square feet of commercial space, part of which would be used by four live-work units. Two of the 50 apartments would be designated as affordable to very-low-income households who make less than 50% of the area median income (AMI), and two others would be affordable to tenants who make 80% of it, as per the agreement reached before the zoning board. The developer would also pay $884,000 into the city's Housing Trust Fund to build affordable housing elsewhere to comply with city rules related to below-market-rate housing. Attorneys for developer Realtex told council in a Feb. 28 letter (Item 4) that more than 110 community members have pledged support for the project.\n\nCity staff recommend that council approve the use permit to allow for the development of three parcels, including the one where AW Pottery operates; its owner plans to retire and relocate, according to staff. The proposed project would demolish existing buildings, merge three lots and construct the new building, which includes stacked parking for 24, and 56 bike parking spots along with a bike repair station.\nStaff notes that the project sought, and received, a concession to allow it to exceed the district's floor area ratio as part of its use permit to reach 6 stories. But according to a new law, effective Jan. 1, the city does not have to approve that concession if it does not result in cost reductions tied to affordable housing. And staff says, in this case, it does not.\nAn architect's rendering of 2902 Adeline, in the distance. Source: Trachtenberg ArchitectsAccording to the city, the appeal raises seven points. The appellants take issue with the way the city calculated the number of affordable units that are required. Staff says the appellants are wrong about their interpretation of the rules.\nDon't miss Berkeleyside's in-depth story on the zoning board hearing from OctoberThe appellants also say the zoning board should have pushed for \"a better deal\" and required mediation with neighbors. City staff said it's not the job of the zoning board to negotiate, and it was clear mediation would not have worked because the neighbors were pushing for community benefits rather than design changes. Community benefits are not required in the district where the project is proposed.\nThe appellants said the board failed to apply part of the state density bonus law related to rent-controlled units; staff said none of the units at issue are under rent control, so there was no reason to consider that.\nAppellants also took issue with the financial analysis, or pro forma, submitted on behalf of the project, calling it \"inaccurate.\" City staff said it hired a professional land economics consulting firm to review the document, as well as a third-party consultant to peer review it, \"and they verified the assumptions and calculations in the analysis.\"\nAppellants say the project is not compatible with the neighborhood due to its size. Staff says the zoning board considered this and ultimately found the 6-story building appropriate, among other reasons, because the building would be on \"one of the broadest intersections in the City\" and across the street from another 6-story building on Russell.\nAppellants say, too, that \"Approving more market-rate units than are required by law is contrary to city goals.\"\nCity staff says that's not right: \"Contrary to the appellants' statement, approving a net increase in the City's housing supply at any income level is supportive of City Policies\" related to economic diversity, transit-oriented new construction and regional housing needs.\nStaff says council basically has to approve a 4-story version of the project, as per state law, writing, \"As a project employing State Density Bonus law, the Council may not preclude the construction of the base project with density bonus units, which is a four story, 25 unit project, with two dwelling units, affordable to Very Low Income households.\"\nThe use permit needed for the fifth and sixth stories, however, is left to the city's discretion.\nAccording to financial papers submitted by the developer as part of the peer-review process, the 6-story project will generate a 5.6% rate of return. That's reportedly less than it might expect from \"similar projects,\" but still \"financially feasible.\" A smaller project, however, would not pencil out, according to the reviewer.\nBefore the special meeting at 7 p.m., two items are scheduled for a 5:30 p.m. council worksession: a new housing demolition mitigation fee, proposed to be set at $105,202 per unit, and a workshop on \"Financial and Infrastructure Opportunities,\" presented by Council Members Linda Maio, Ben Bartlett and Lori Droste. According to workshop materials, the low-interest-rate environment makes it a good time for the city to refinance some of its bonds.\nCouncil will discuss those items but no action takes place at worksessions.

In March, BPD presents the annual crime report about the prior year. Then, in September, BPD presents data from the first six months of the current calendar year. Neither report goes into much detail, and is focused instead on \"part one\" crimes -- eight types of felonies -- that are tracked nationally by the FBI.\nThe FBI tracks four violent crimes -- murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- and four property crimes -- burglary, larceny, auto theft and arson. Police said, overall, these part one crimes were down 7% in 2016, which followed the trend seen in the first half of the year.\nThe department does not analyze the crime rate or look at how crime statistics relate to changes in the city's population.\n\nIn Berkeley last year, aggravated assaults increased 35%, from 135 to 183 reports. Aggravated assaults have been on the increase in Berkeley since 2012, when there were only 108 of them.\n\"This increase includes a number of shootings, as well as a higher number of aggravated assaults occurring in the downtown and south campus areas, and which frequently involved alcohol or drug abuse by [the] victim and/or suspect and frequently involved acquaintances,\" police wrote in the report.\nRegarding the shootings, Interim Police Chief Andrew Greenwood said in January of this year that about 300 calls had come in since January 2016 about possible gunfire, although police only found evidence of gunfire in 35 incidents.\nAccording to the crime report, robberies increased about 9%, from 331 in 2015 to 362 in 2016. The Berkeley Police Department said the increase reflected a wave of pedestrian robberies north of the UC Berkeley campus, as well as a \"significant commercial robbery series.\"\nReported sexual assaults increased 29%, from 41 in 2015 to 53 last year. Police said 79% of the reports involved an acquaintance, while nine involved strangers. Of the stranger sexual assaults, five were part of an unsolved series in the area south of the UC Berkeley campus. Police said three others resulted in arrests or the identification of the person responsible. The department added a full-time sexual assault investigator to its Special Victims Unit team last year due to the rise.\nLast year, BPD also arrested a man they say raped several women in 2008 after using DNA and fingerprints to link him to the crimes.\nIn 2016, there were two homicides -- Alex Goodwin Jr., 22, and 19-year-old Gregory Ignacio Jr. -- compared to one the prior year. No arrests have been made in the Goodwin case, but Ignacio's alleged killer is facing a murder charge. Homicides in Berkeley have been on a downward trend since 2012, when there were five, according to the report.\nProperty crimes fell in 2016. Source: BPDOn the property crime side, burglaries showed a steep decrease, down 26% over the prior year, when they peaked at 1,089. In fact, in 2016 they were at their lowest level since 2012, the earliest year included in the report. Home burglaries dropped about 22%, while commercial burglaries dropped 37%.\nBPD said reducing property crime had been one of its goals in 2016.\nPolice also said the arrest of a \"prolific career burglar\" in Oakland, who had been targeting businesses in Berkeley and Emeryville, helped drive the reduction.\nLarcenies were down by nearly 5%, and auto thefts decreased 9%, from 713 to 647.\nArson reports held steady at 20. Two of those cases involved one person with a history of arson and mental illness. Half the incidents were trashcan or dumpster fires, police said.\nBPD has continued to struggle to provide sufficient information to the community, though Interim Chief Greenwood -- appointed last fall -- says he is committed to making that a priority.\nLast year, BPD failed to launch any sort of social media program, despite promises to do so that go back years. According to a report in September, \"The department is ... working with the City PIO to develop and implement a social media strategy using Facebook, Twitter, Nextdoor and GovDelivery.\"\nBPD has moved from 14 beats to 16 beats in response to officer and community concerns. Source: BPDLast year, the department said it developed a \"mission, vision and values\" statement to help guide its actions, reorganized its departmental divisions to make operations more efficient, and changed -- in January of this year -- to a 16-beat structure for patrol that it hopes will work better than the 14-beat structure it adopted in recent years.\nBPD has also been working to boost staffing, which had fallen to precipitous levels, and is continuing that effort in 2017.\nAccording to the report, other achievements last year included a BPD collaboration with the Berkeley Unified School District on a class focused on law enforcement careers (a Berkeleyside story is forthcoming); expanded training for officers in de-escalation techniques; and the continued use of Nixle alerts to put out periodic information to the community.\nThe crime report is part of a nationwide effort, driven by the FBI, to collect data from 17,000 law enforcement agencies across the United States. The goal of this effort, called the Uniform Crime Report, is \"to generate a reliable set of crime statistics for use in law enforcement administration, operation, and management in the United States.\"\nThe FBI discourages comparisons among jurisdictions \"because of the complex variables affecting crime and crime reporting practices.\"\nThe crime report is scheduled to come before council Tuesday, March 14, in a special meeting at 5:30 p.m. The council session tends to include additional details, and examples of significant cases and arrests from the year.\nBerkeley Police spokesman Sgt.

I'm a 45-year-long Berkeley resident, the last 17 as a homeowner. But I haven't always been proud of my town. For the 14 years of the Bates council, I was frustrated and depressed to see Berkeley become a poster child for how to minimize construction of new affordable housing in a city that loves to think that its council members are all dedicated progressives.\nWhen Tom Bates became mayor, Berkeley required that 20% of its new mixed use residential (residential over first-floor commercial) - the overwhelming generator of our affordable housing construction - meet affordability standards. Under Bates, and with the help of then-staff attorney, now city attorney Zach Cowan and our then-Zoning Officer, now downtown developer frontman Mark Rhoades, state density law was radically reinterpreted to reduce that number to barely over 10%. Berkeley fell from a state leader in affordable housing policy to deep into the bottom half.\nWhen Moulitsas claims that newly elected mayor Arreguin, formerly district 4 council member, voted against or abstained on 1,500 units of housing, he's apparently using opposition research from Arreguin's November opponent, real estate agent Laurie Capitelli. This research is, unsurprisingly, heavily flawed, and in several ways. Most importantly, it mischaracterizes what happens when construction approval comes before the Council. Moulitsas suggests that Arreguin's votes reflect kowtowing to nimby neighbors. The record shows that Arreguin opposed those projects for their failure to supply adequate affordable housing, which the council had the power to increase but consistently chose not to. (Or, in a couple of cases, because of demolition of rent-controlled units.) Council hearings are never about whether or not to build: empty lots eventually get buildings. The question is about what sort of project gets built.\nMoulitsas apparently wants a council that will approve all building permit requests, no matter how appropriate a given project may be. He's a true believer, and that belief seems be that if you just let developers loose to build whatever they can make the most money on, the housing market will improve for everyone. That is free-market nonsense.\nThe downtown property owners always run a just-build-everything candidate in district 4. We've always slapped them down, because we know that what happens in downtown has direct effects on our neighborhoods. Gould is the downtown property owners' candidate this time, as a glance at the city website (click public access portal, search for Gould) will reveal.

If all that you want is more Gaia buildings with students crammed two- and-three-up into tiny bedrooms, Gould may well be your guy. But if you believe that our city council should be focusing on the long-term needs of its low- and middle-income residents, with a commitment to truly affordable housing as a top priority, then you'll want to keep this district in progressive hands, and those hands are attached to Kate Harrison.

Some individuals from both sides were aggressive and hostile, but many of the pro-Trump demonstrators behaved peacefully and said they had come to support free speech, particularly after the violent protests that happened after far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos came to Berkeley on Feb. 1.\nAt least seven people were injured and police made ten arrests.

Among the items confiscated by police were metal pipes, bats, \"2 x 4s,\" and pieces of wood. A group with bricks was detained and the bricks confiscated.

At 2:40 p.m. Officer Byron White of BPD said there had not been any arrests.\nFollow Berkeleyside's live coverage of the protest on Twitter #berkeleyprotest\nMany of the pro-Trump people had come in from out of town.\nThe first person to show up with a March For Trump sign was Tito Mena who said he was a US citizen although his family was from Tijuana, Mexico. Mena said he had come to Berkeley to uphold freedom of speech and that he did not condone violence. \"I stand with the President,\" he said, adding that he did not think the president's accomplishments were being well-reported. \"The media is blowing everything out of proportion,\" he said. \"All the good things Trump is doing are being buried in sensationalism.\" Asked by a reporter what good things he thought the president had done, he mentioned the Trans Pacific Partnership and the Keystone Pipeline. \"Building the pipeline will mean using American steel and creating American jobs,\" he said.\nBerkeleyside spoke to several people who had got up at 4 a.m. to drive up from Orange County, as well as one person from Pacifica and one from Livermore.\nBrian Medina from Orange County said he had come to support free speech. Describing himself as \"a libertarian more than a conservative,\" he said he had seen what happened at the Milo Yiannopoulos protests in Berkeley on Feb. 1. \"I saw how the violence started and it was awful,\" he said. Medina said he assumed the rioting was started by anarchists, and assumed they were from the far left.\nThe crowd at Civic Center Park around 2 p.m. on March 4.

Photo: Tracey TaylorThe origin of the pro-Trump protest is unclear, although a group called March For Trump posted it would be holding a demonstration at Civic Center Park in Berkeley at 2 p.m. Saturday. Similar demos were planned for around the country Saturday, including at the Washington Monument in DC. The stated purpose: to unite against a \"seditious fringe [that] has resolved to sabotage [President Trump's] restored purpose\" of putting \"America first.\" The Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary (BAMN) -- announced a counter-protest to the pro-Trump demo, stating its purpose is to \"confront and defeat the Trump movement\" with \"no platform for fascists and white supremacists.\"\nAt midday there was a peaceful atmosphere at the park, with the weekly farmers' market in full swing and just a few reporters with cameras and notepads waiting to see what, if anything, would transpire. A representative from the Ecology Center, which runs the farmers' markets in Berkeley, said he had not noticed any change in the number of people showing up at the market.\nAt around 12:30 p.m. about 20 police officers arrived and took up positions on the south side of the park and on the elevated section next to the Peace Wall. Armed with batons, as well as at least one video camera, they at first observed from a distance. A handful of officers were stationed at the entrance to downtown Berkeley BART station from around noon.\n\n\nSome protesters are seeking confrontation, or the edge of it. #berkeleyprotests pic.twitter.com/BhkubHgDtB\n-- Berkeleyside (@berkeleyside) March 4, 2017\n\nBetween 1 and 1:30 p.m. pro-Trump supporters began to arrive in small groups or individuals on their own. Some carried flags, mostly the stars and stripes as well as at least one black and yellow anarcho-capitalism flag. Some wore red baseball caps and others leather biker-style jackets. A Russian flag could also be seen in the crowd, although it was unclear what type of protester was carrying it.\nAt first, the BAMN group was congregated on the west side of the park and it kickstarted proceedings with controversial BUSD teacher Yvette Felarca making a speech through a megaphone.\nThe video below, shot at 1:38 p.m., shows BAMN group chanting in the direction of the Trump supporters who were grouped together about a hundred yards away across the park:\n\nAs numbers swelled on both sides, for about one hour there were two discrete groups separated by a large stretch of green lawn -- rather like a middle-school dance with the girls on one side of the room and the boys on the other.\nBy around 2 p.m. the groups had drawn closer together, and, as they merged, the odd confrontational conversation had escalated into at least one fight. There were also relatively calm conversations taking place among those from opposing sides aiming to have a constructive dialogue.\n\n\n\"I tried to break up the fight and someone slugged me,\" said Fred Sutter. #berkeleyprotests pic.twitter.com/gtvt62IJup\n-- Berkeleyside (@berkeleyside) March 4, 2017\n\nBerkeleyside spoke with Timothy Watkins, originally from New Orleans. Watkins has lived in San Francisco for five years but today was the first day he had been to the East Bay. A self-described \"person of color and homosexual,\" he said Trump had brought him to Berkeley. He said he had \"come out of hiding\" to show his support for President Trump and to encourage others like himself to do the same. He said he believed the president had the back of both gay people and people of color.\nDuring the protest different groups chanted slogans and sang songs. At one point, after the first fight had broken out, a group of pro-Trump supporters were urged by one of their own to \"take a knee so that the police can do their job,\" which about 12 of them did.\nTimothy Watkins, a Trump supporter came to Berkeley protest to encourage other gay people of color to stand up for their president. Photo: Tracey Taylor\"I'm here for freedom of speech for everybody,\" said Trish Cress, a woman from Healdsburg who was wearing a red \"Make America Great Again\" baseball cap. \"We should be able to gather here peacefully. I saw people get beaten up.\"\nBerkeley City Councilman Ben Bartlett was at the protest, and State Senator Nancy Skinner was there for a time too.\nThroughout the main protest at the park, from midday to around 5 p.m., there were no helicopters overhead. Around 5 p.m. when a only a few stragglers, most of whom seemed to be either Antifa or BAMN related, remained, a red helicopter did begin to hover over the park. Protesters, some of whom were wearing all black and wearing bandanas, were goading the police and some threw eggs. Several arrests were made.\n\n\nMan pepper sprayed.

Photo: Nancy RubinThe city is preparing for a potential pro-Trump demonstration planned for Saturday at 2 p.m. at Civic Center Park in downtown Berkeley, as well as for a counter-protest that has been called for noon in the same location.\n\"We're planning for a number of different contingencies,\" said city spokesman Matthai Chakko Friday. Chakko said the expectation was that the pro-Trump event would be a \"small gathering of people.\" Nobody has filed for the necessary permit to hold a protest, he said. \"Somebody contacted the city expressing interest, but they didn't respond to our calls back,\" he said.\nOn the surface, it appears that a group called March For Trump is spearheading the demonstration, as Berkeley is listed as one of many locations where protests are being planned around the country Saturday, including at the Washington Monument in DC. March for Trump states the purpose of the events is to unite against a \"seditious fringe [that] has resolved to sabotage [President Trump's] restored purpose\" of putting \"America first.\" However, the Berkeley event's Facebook page, linked to on the March for Trump's site, lists Rich Black as the leader of the demo.\nWhen contacted by Berkeleyside Friday, Black said he alone was organizing the event. Black said the purpose of the Berkeley event was \"to promote free speech\" and that it would be \"a peaceful gathering.\" He said a permit was not required for such a demonstration and declined to say how many people he anticipated would show up. The Facebook event page lists 152 people as attending, with 244 interested in attending from a total of 483 invited.\n\nNo local groups, political or otherwise, have said they are affiliated with the Berkeley pro-Trump event. A Feb. 8 article in Breitbart News about pro-Trump demonstrations across the country directed readers to the Main Street Patriots website which lists more than 50 rallies scheduled for Saturday, but none in Berkeley.\nOn Feb. 27, Black posted on Twitter, where he has just 87 followers, a statement that stressed the protest was peaceful: \"We are to arrive at Berkeley in the name of peace and in hopes to show the world that freedom is a fire that refuses to be extinguished,\" he wrote. \"Take pity on those who are lost in a sea of rage... Be the peace that Berkeley deserves.\"\nMeanwhile the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary (BAMN) -- has announced a counter-protest to the pro-Trump demo, stating its purpose is to \"confront and defeat the Trump movement\" with \"no platform for fascists and white supremacists.\" A focus of the action, the group says, is to defend Berkeley's sanctuary city status.\nNervousness about the Saturday protests has been fueled by events in Berkeley on Feb. 1 when a peaceful gathering to protest the later-canceled appearance of far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos on the Cal campus was disrupted by more than 100 black-clad agitators. The demonstration turned violent, several people were injured, and the agitators caused extensive property damage, both at UC Berkeley and downtown.\nLocal residents have also expressed concern about the location of Saturday's protests which is the site of the farmers market.\nRead about the Milo Yiannopoulos protests in Berkeley.\"One of my primary concerns is the proximity to the market and the potential for a reaction that endangers farmers and families at the farmer's market by a bad reaction from either side,\" wrote one reader to Berkeleyside.\nChakko said the city was coordinating its efforts with the farmers market.\nAnother reader wrote encouraging Berkeleyside to provide information about the protest, \"given that it could potentially be violent/dangerous\" and \"folks might want to avoid it.\"\nAt least one downtown business has decided to close on Saturday because of the proposed demonstrations. In an email shared with Berkeleyside, Kristine Seinsch, owner of Jazzcaffe, said for the safety of its employees she has decided to keep the cafe on Addison Street, closed during the day. She hopes to be open for an evening concert there.\nChakko said the Berkeley Police had reached out to the people it understood were the organizers of the pro-Trump demo, as they do routinely ahead of any planned protests.\n\"The police talk to them about being adequately prepared, advise them on how to be safe, and the need for a permit,\" he said.\nThe city's website has a Protest 101 section with advice for anyone interested in organizing or participating in a protest.\nWhile the police say they are preparing for any potential problems Saturday, they cannot say precisely what those preparations involve, including how many officers might be mobilized. At the Yiannopoulos demonstration both BPD and UCPD kept their distance and only one arrest was made. Afterwards both agencies were criticized for what was perceived by many commentators as too hands-off a response. BPD Chief Andrew Greenwood said the department's approach had been informed by the East Bay Black Lives Matters protests of 2014. \"Placing police officers into a potentially volatile crowd situation could have prompted a focused, sustained violent attack on police, thereby rapidly escalating the risk of harm to all involved,\" he wrote in a two-page memo to Berkeley City Manager Dee Williams-Ridley about the Yiannopoulos protest. (Read Berkeleyside's story on that memo and our interview with UCPD Chief Margo Bennett about that department's approach to handling the Feb. 1 protest.)\nChakko said the goal of the city in preparing for protests is to protect free speech and keep the community safe, but he acknowledged there is always an unknown element.\n\"We know demonstrations can be dynamic with the potential to transform from peaceful assembly to violence,\" he said. \"People can have different motives and interests during a demonstration.\"\nThis developing story was updated after publication.\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "City prepares for pro-Trump demo, counter-protest in Berkeley", "Tags": "['Berkeley Police', 'Berkeley protests', 'By Any Means Necessary', 'Donald Trump', 'Public safety']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Community', 'Downtown']", "Natural Language Location": "Civic Center Park", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8693718", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "249979", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.274042", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/03/city-prepares-pro-trump-demo-counter-protest-berkeley/", "Author": "Tracey Taylor", "Date": "2017-03-03T14:00:44-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "I am surprised to see, less than a week before the end of voting, what can only be described as a polemical and inaccurate hit piece written by Eric Panzer, my opponent's campaign treasurer (and former City Council contender). The opinion piece incorrectly states my position on affordable housing. Instead of using proxies to discuss the issues, I have decided to directly address the voters and readers of Berkeleyside.\nMy policies will make Berkeley more affordable, more inclusionary, and preserve Berkeley's unique character at a lower cost to our community.\nTo cut to the chase, Ben Gould's campaign raises a false dichotomy: approve anything a developer offers or be labelled anti-growth. Many cities think coherently about these choices: let's require that developments pay their fair share of costs (for affordable housing transit, parks, traffic mitigation), reasonably fit with our neighborhoods and are appropriately sized for their lots.\nBerkeley's Downtown Plan, which I supported, approved, but did not mandate, that Berkeley build tall buildings, and it also required that these buildings provide significant community benefits. A well-designed building in Downtown that paid its fair share of costs - YES; however, a 20-story building on top of North Berkeley BART, as one of my opponents' long-time supporters proposed - NO. The new hotel Downtown is a good example of a well-thought out project that the entire council supported.\nThe Sierra Club endorsed me for my stance on smart infill development in urban areas and near transit corridors, with an emphasis on smart. The Sierra Club, former San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, the Berkeley Tenants Union, and the entire Berkeley Rent Board have endorsed me for the District 4 council seat for my strong support of affordable housing for ALL of Berkeley's residents. It is precisely local, middle- and lower-income housing that is needed to get people who work here out of their cars and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nBerkeley has met far more of its share of the regional housing needs for market-rate housing built or in the planning stages. The need Berkeley is not meeting, and which the market does not seem able to provide, is for \"moderate\" and \"low-income\" housing for Berkeley's schoolteachers, nurses, firefighters and police officers, which the public sector will need to help make possible.\nContrary to the assertions made by Panzer in his opinion piece, Ben Gould's housing policies are a repackaging of the \"trickle-down economics\" theory that economic benefits provided to upper income level earners will help society as a whole, which we are unfortunately seeing again in the Trump administration.\nIn an op-ed published on Berkeleyside on May 28, 2015, Gould describes his housing policy as, \"If new housing is built for the wealthy that will reduce the demand for existing overpriced homes and slow the growth in home values. Building affordable housing will likely have little impact on market prices, as the people who need affordable housing aren't driving demand...\" In other words, let the speculators and out-of-town developers build for the rich, and ignore everybody else. In fact, most studies show that specifically building affordable housing brings down the overall cost of housing more than building only luxury, market rate housing.\nGould has yet to find a building project he doesn't like. He has proposed building six-story buildings along all of Sacramento Street, essentially surrounding the southern portion of District 4 with a solid wall of buildings, criticized Laurie Capitelli for not being pro-development enough for refusing to endorse six-story buildings on Solano Avenue, and expressed disappointment that the ill-designed Pacific School of Religion (Holy Hill) project was cancelled. In his writings, he has endorsed \"by right\" development, which gives the \"right\" to build to the developer and eviscerates local input into the development process, a proposal roundly rejected by the California Legislature.\nPanzer's opinion piece posits it will take $38 million/year to meet Berkeley's affordable-housing needs. I was the volunteer coordinator for the overwhelmingly approved Measure U1 landlord tax, raising $4 million/year for affordable housing. Surprisingly, given my opponent's emphasis on \"data-driven\" solutions, Gould does not appear to understand how this money can be leveraged to build significantly more housing.  Each of these dollars can be leveraged by federal tax credits, Alameda County's $600 million affordable housing bond, and the rental revenues from the projects themselves.\nI have also proposed a tax on short-term rentals and a transfer tax on high-valued homes. In contrast, my opponent opposed the landlord tax and instead proposes a regressive tax on \"underutilized\" back yards to help convert them from play areas, BBQs, and vegetable gardens to more housing. Again, you would pay while those benefitting most from the increase in property values walk away for free.\nFinally, Panzer's opinion piece mentions the $10 million in one-time affordable housing fees from the Harold Way project, but conveniently fails to mention my role in the process. It was the successful advocacy of numerous citizens and community groups that coalesced into Berkeley Progressive Action (BPA) which I helped co-found, that doubled the amount of fees Harold Way was required to pay from the initial developer proposal. We also successfully raised the affordable housing fee from $20,000 to $34,000 per unit for new projects going forward.   Ben Gould chose not to take a position in these debates.\nBerkeley consists of its people and its neighborhoods. It is a city, not just a \"transit corridor\" to somewhere else. Housing is not the only issue in this race.

Photo: Nancy RubinThe Central Branch of the Berkeley Public Library looked fabulous Feb. 11, the night of the annual dinner to celebrate local authors. The long tables in the main reading room on the second floor had been moved to make way for round tables covered in black tablecloths adorned with book-themed centerpieces. Large flat-screened television sets were placed strategically so all of the guests, who had paid at least $500 a ticket to be there, could see when hosts Linda Schacht Gage and former television anchor Bill Schechner introduced the authors. The lineup included the chair of the evening, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner T.J. Stiles, as well as Maxine Hong Kingston, Dave Eggers, Vendela Vida and more.\nGage and Schechner also took some extra time to introduce Heidi Dolamore, the new director of the library. Dolamore, who assumed the post in September, spoke briefly about libraries and the power of books. She then extended a welcome to Elliot Warren, who had just taken the post of deputy library director.\nThe annual Author's Dinner, produced by the Berkeley Public Library Foundation, is always an evening of triumph for the library. The event sells out in advance and raises thousands of dollars that is used to buy furniture and equipment and to remodel parts of the libraries.\nBut this year, tension lurked below the surface of the glitzy event. A number of the library staff helping out during the evening said their workplace had become a place of discomfort and distrust. Over the past 18 months, the library administration, they said, has questioned the actions of some of the staff, particularly those who have been vocal about recent library policies. Seven staff members have been subjected to an amorphous investigation on \"potential misconduct\" that has gone on so long the ACLU has lodged a formal complaint. Some staff members were told they were \"insubordinate,\" may have \"violated\" library policies and could be fired, according to half a dozen employees who asked not to be identified because they fear for their jobs.\n\nThe result is an atmosphere of fear and intimidation in many departments, particularly at the Central Branch. The employee union, SEIU Local 1021, has filed numerous grievances, many against one manager. One employee was fired and then rehired after he threatened to file a wrongful termination suit. A number of employees have left as a result of the work atmosphere, according to multiple interviews with library staff.\nBerkeley officials have said they are not, nor ever have, investigated city staff based on union identification or for criticizing city policies. City officials understand and respect the contracts it has with its unions, according to an August memo written by City Manager Dee Williams-Ridley.\nThe president of the Board of Library Trustees (BOLT), Julie Holcomb, wrote in an email to Berkeleyside: \"I can say that I have the full confidence that the Library, and the City of which it is a part, respects and fully complies with all worker protections, including all negotiated agreements with our unions, as well as all applicable State and Federal laws.\" Holcomb said she cannot comment on personnel issues.\nYet even the Berkeley City Council has recognized the challenges faced by some library staffers. On Feb. 28, on the recommendation of City Councilman Kriss Worthington, Mayor Jesse Arreguin issued a proclamation declaring that day \"Berkeley Librarian Whistleblower Day.\" (See the proclamation.)\n\n\nTonight we honor our courageous library whistleblowers. #berkmtg pic.twitter.com/RaQYm3WnfL\n-- Jesse Arreguin (@JesseArreguin) March 1, 2017\n\nThe proclamation commended a group of 20-25 people for pointing out that in 2015 the library, under former director Jeff Scott, had embarked on an aggressive book-weeding program that mostly excluded the input of senior librarians. Scott initially defended the program and said publicly that only 2,200 books had been thrown out, and none of them had been checked out in more than three years. He said that book weeding -- known technically as \"deaccession\" --was an important process that kept a library's collection current and it was part of best practices.\nA number of current and former librarians disputed Scott's assertions. They held protests outside the Central Branch to call attention to the fact the library was jettisoning a process that had long used the expertise of senior librarians and exchanged it for one that relied on decisions by just a few managers.\nSome librarians praised the new weeding process and called it long overdue, however.\n\"In my 18 years in Berkeley, I have never witnessed anyone approach weeding with [the] clear head or regularity needed to keep a collection fresh, vital, and above all useful to the population it's intended to serve,\" wrote Nora Hale, a children's librarian at the West Branch, in a September 2015 letter. \"On the contrary, the overriding culture at BPL has been to hold onto books at any cost.... Since we are a public library, not an archive or a research library, it is not only reasonable but responsible to weed the collection based on usage rather than nostalgia or our individual sense of what is (or should be) valuable. Our patrons, by their choice of material checked out, let us know in no uncertain terms what it is they value and use at their public library. Our space is limited, and books really do need to earn their keep, so to speak.\"\nRead more about the Berkeley library book-weeding controversy.The disgruntled librarians insisted that Scott was hiding the scope of the weeding process. They contacted Worthington with their own calculation of the number of books that had been tossed. Worthington then went to the library, asked to use Scott's computer, and then showed the director that 39,140 books had been discarded, not 2,200. Scott said he was shocked, insisted that his staff had never told him that number, and resigned a short time later.\nBut the problems did not stop with Scott's August 2015 resignation, according to Worthington.\n\"Some librarian whistleblowers in their defense of the public interest have reported harassment, gag orders, and threats of termination,\" read the Feb. 28 proclamation.\n\"The employees are still reporting they are the victims of harassment and intimidation,\" Worthington said last week. \"It's a very hostile workplace\"\nThe question now in people's minds is whether Dolamore, who inherited the controversy, will resolve the tensions. Worthington is hopeful.\n\"I am optimistic that Heidi will be able to wrap herself around the issue and bring some healing to it,\" he said. \"You can't expect someone to [immediately] heal great gaping wounds that have been bleeding for some time. It's going to take time.\"\nDolamore told Berkeleyside she has taken a number of steps to improve staff morale since her arrival. She has launched an employee engagement group \"to start having open conversations about what kind of place do we want to create for ourselves? What does it mean to feel you can contribute your best everyday? How can we all take steps to build our connections as a team? We are just getting started with that.\" She also sent out a 12-question survey, designed by Gallup, to gauge workers' attitude.\nDolamore declined, however, to discuss the ongoing investigation into various staff members, citing personnel privacy issues.\nHeidi Dolamore, left, director of the Berkeley Public Library. Photo: Frances DinkelspielBut several employees have said that, while they had high hopes for Dolamore, so far she has disappointed them. One of her ideas to improve employee morale was to put up flyers in the elevators with encouraging messages such as \"You are appreciated,\" they said, suggesting this was not enough.\nDolamore has not taken the time to fan out among the workforce to get to know them individually or ask about their concerns, they said. She only met with union officials for the first time in January, three months after she started as director.\n\"That's how you are going to assess employee engagement?\" asked Andrea Mullarkey, a shop steward for SEIU Local 1021 and a teen librarian at the Tarea Hall Pittman South Branch library. \"Not by talking to employees but by making them take an online survey? ... We had been hopeful that they [the Board Of Library Trustees] would select a director who would be inclusive and a great listener and really interested in bringing a sense of peace to the library operations. That is not who they chose. They chose a person who continues to have a top-down, hierarchical approach to decisions.\"\nAnd the book weeding controversy continues\nThe heart of the continuing tension between the library administration, the BOLT, and some library staff appears to be the controversial book-weeding program, even though it seems to have been informally scaled back.\nIn January 2016, before the appointment of Dolamore, BOLT hired Beth Pollard as interim library director. Pollard did not have a library degree but she had served as an interim deputy city manager in Berkeley for a few months and had been Albany's city manager for 12 years. BOLT directors praised her administrative experience.\nPollard stepped in and continued the centralized collection process started by Scott and repeatedly endorsed by BOLT.\n\"The library's practice is for trained, experienced librarians to evaluate materials in the library's collection on a regular and ongoing basis, using self-generated statistical requirements as a first step,\" Williams-Ridley wrote in that August memo. \"During the review process, materials are evaluated by many criteria, some of which include age and/or currency of material, condition and community interest, among other factors. Materials may be removed, replaced or repaired after professional review. Throughout this process, all staff are encouraged to participate in the many avenues available for their input.\"\nWhile the Central Branch continued an aggressive approach to book weeding, other branches were basically left alone to come up with their own approaches, said Mullarkey.\n\"It's a completely ad-hoc process,\" she said. \"Each location, each division is doing whatever they think they have to do to get it done.\"\nSome librarians found adult books that had not been checked out for three years (or nine months in the case of teen or children's books) that would have been earmarked for deaccessioning, but which they thought should remain on the library shelves. So some of the librarians used their own library cards to check out those books and then quickly return them. This created a circulation record for the book, ensuring it would stay on the shelves.\nBerkeley librarians have been doing this for decades and even got Scott's explicit permission to do so, according to Mullarkey, who recounted to Berkeleyside her own recent experiences with culling.\nMullarkey works in the teen section at the South Branch and, she said, if she didn't weed out books there soon would not be any room on the shelves since the library acquires so many books.\nMullarkey does a computer search to see which books have not been checked out in the previous nine months and selects ones to weed from that list. But there are often books that show up on the list that Mullarkey knows should remain in the system, she said. For example, in the past few weeks, Richard Wright's Native Son, a classic, appeared on the list of books that had not been recently checked out. But the book is often assigned at Berkeley High and other schools, so Mullarkey knows it belongs in the library system. Mullarkey checked Native Son out and back in using her own library card so the book would not be flagged again soon.\nMullarkey cited books about gender identity, family dynamics and sexuality that fall in that same category. Teens often come into the library to look at those books but don't check them out. Mullarkey knows that the books are used, even if there is no circulation record.\n\"I find them lying all over the teen room because people are picking them up and browsing them and not taking them home,\" she said. \"Of course I need to have those books. They are important for young people. Just because they don't run though our system doesn't mean they aren't valued.\"\nBerkeley is not the only place where library staffers have used their or others' library cards to check out books to make sure they remain in circulation.\nIn Orlando, two library employees created the fictional \"Chuck Finley\" who checked out 2,361 books over a nine-month period, according to the Orlando Sentinel. The intent was, according to Boing Boing \"to trick the system into believing that the books they loved were being circulated to the library's patrons, thus rescuing the books from automated purges of low-popularity titles.\" George Dore, of one of the employees said: \"He wanted to avoid having to later repurchase books purged from the shelf,\" according to the Sentinel.  \"He said the same thing is being done at other libraries, too.\"\nBut in Berkeley, this process -- of librarians using their own library cards to ensure certain books remain in circulation -- has become the focus of an investigation that that has now been going on for ten months. In April 2016, Pollard enlisted the help of Camille Hamilton Pating, a senior attorney for Meyers Nave, a law firm frequently hired by the city of Berkeley. While the focus of the investigation remains secret, it appears to focus on librarians who used their own cards to check books out and in. Pating asked Rachel MacNeilly, a senior library administrator who headed up Scott's book-weeding process to look into the circulation records of various staff members. Sarah Dentan, then the deputy library director, sent out about seven letters to various staff (now known by some library staff as \"the Reference 7\") on April 18, 2016, informing them that the library was \"investigating potential misconduct on their part.\" In what may or may not be a coincidence, the staffers who were targeted were all those who had been vocally opposed to the weeding practices under Scott, or were active in the union. (See one of the letters.)\nThe letter ordered the staff members not to discuss the issue with anyone other than their union representative. The employees were told they could not share the letter with anyone else. It told them to appear at a certain time and certain place in City Hall to answer Pating's questions. The letters said they had to answer all questions posed and \"be honest and forthright,\" and not to \"withhold any information.\"\nThe employees were also told to bring their cell phones into the interview so they could be checked -- so the investigator could examine them for any communication regarding the library -- and to not destroy any emails with other people under investigation. The employees were instructed to print out relevant communications and bring them to the interview.\n\"Although I anticipate your full cooperation, I must inform you that failure to attend the investigatory interview, cooperate in the investigation, and/or follow these directives may be deemed insubordination and separate grounds for discipline, up to and including termination of employment,\" stated the letters.\nOne employee was informed the library was investigating his unauthorized use of another patron's card. The card belonged to his brother-in-law, who knew how it was being deployed, according to library staff.\nThe employees who were ordered to appear described the meetings as \"scary\" and \"excruciating.\"\n\"It's very upsetting for the people involved,\" said Mullarkey, who estimates that 75% of the library's roughly 130 employees have deep concerns about the library administration.\nThe investigation prompted 104 protest emails expressing concern about \"the library whistleblowers\" to be sent to the City Council, prompting Worthington to ask Williams-Ridley to investigate. She concluded that there was no \"witch hunt\" against vocal employees and said only one employee was being disciplined, but not for issues related to weeding. Williams-Ridley noted that the majority of the emails appeared to be identical and that it appeared they came from an orchestrated campaign.\nBerkeley Public Library Foundation Authors Dinner 2017, held at the Central Library on Feb. 11. Photo: Frances DinkelspielOn Sept. 22, Jose Martinez, a field representative for SEIU Local 1021, sent a letter to Dentan expressing \"grave concerns about the revelation that manager Rachel MacNeilly has been reviewing the patron records of union members..... This kind of snooping raises serious privacy concerns.\"\nOne library specialist and union activist, who has asked that Berkeleyside not use her name, then filed a grievance. She charged that the library, by investigating a patron's circulation record, was violating its own privacy policies, as well as other city and state codes.\nDolamore denied the grievance in a Feb. 8 letter, and said that the searches done by MacNeilly were on the orders of the library director and city attorney. Dolamore denied that the search violated the library's Patron Privacy Policy or state law.\n\"Furthermore, these reports were generated as a direct result of the Library's obligation to respond to potential non-compliance with City policies and State regulations,\" wrote Dolamore. \"That investigation activity is specifically exempted from Gov't Code 6267; accordingly, your grievance on that issue is denied.\"\nThe length of the investigation has drawn the attention of the ACLU, which sent a critical letter to BOLT on Dec. 29.\nThe investigation \"appears to include protected activities of the library employees relating to matters of public concern,\" wrote Alan Schlosser, senior counsel for the ACLU office in northern California. \"This raises questions about the free speech and privacy rights of the employees, particularly those who have spoken out about library issues and who have been critical of library policies. \"\nThe letter went on to say that the length of the investigation and its broad, unfocused scope was a concern. It cited an opinion issued by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that criticized an eight-month-long investigation done by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \"The investigation by the HUD officials unquestionably chilled the plaintiffs' exercise of their First Amendment Rights,\" the opinion read, according to the ACLU letter.\nUnion officials have heard that Pating's investigation was completed in January and that the results are sitting on Dolamore's desk. No action has been taken, nor has there been an announcement that the investigation did not turn up any wrongdoing, leaving many staff members still on edge, staffers said.\nIn fact, the Gallup survey Dolamore asked staffers to take turned up deep dissatisfaction in the ranks, according to Mullarkey. The survey ranked Berkeley Library workers against all the other workers in the world who have taken the independent survey. The poll revealed that only 2% of the library workers are satisfied with their jobs, according to Mullarkey, who sits on the library employee engagement committee.\n\"The results show that BPL staff are in the bottom 2% of all people who have taken the survey,\" she said at a BOLT meeting Wednesday night. \"That means that 98% of people who have ever taken the survey, in public, private, and nonprofit institutions, are more satisfied with their workplace than BPL staff.\"\nBefore the results of the survey were known, Dolamore told Berkeleyside how proud she was to lead a library system so attuned to its community, and so committed to providing the best service possible. She commended the staff for their commitment to service, innovation and free speech.\n\"We want to create an environment where everyone is welcome,\" she said.\nThis story was updated after publication to include the example of checking out books in Orlando.\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "Staffers at Berkeley Library describe atmosphere of discomfort and distrust", "Tags": "['Berkeley Public Library']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Community', 'Library', 'Nonprofits']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley Public Library", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8681512", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "249894", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2706517", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/02/staffers-at-berkeley-library-describe-atmosphere-of-discomfort-and-distrust/", "Author": "Frances Dinkelspiel", "Date": "2017-03-02T13:00:27-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Rep.

Lee later took to the march holding a banner that said, \"Black Women of Congress,\" along with Yvette Clark (D-N.Y.), Shelia Jackson Lee (D-Texas), and Brenda Lawrence (D-Michigan).\nLeslie Silket from Oakland marched wearing a pink hat knitted for her by her dental hygienist. \"I'm here standing in for those back home who can't march,\" she said. Silket also cited the criticism that the Women's March did not have the racial diversity of other protests and, as a black woman, Silket felt \"it was much more important\" for her to be at the D.C. march than at the ones in the Bay Area.\n\"There's so few of us here, I just felt like we had to be represented,\" she said.\nLeslie Silket traveled from Oakland to march in D.C. \"I'm standing in for those who can't march,\" she said.

Everything that Trump's cabinet devalues, I value,\" she said.\nShe remarked that she was inspired by the number of Bay Area women she met while marching. \"I think we were very well-represented,\" she said. \"And I think we're going to have a lot to bring back to our community.\"\nBerkeley residents Avery Lyman, 10, and Stephanie Jersey, 11, pose with their homemade sign depicting the Golden Gate Bridge at the D.C. march.

The marchers protested anyway. Photo: Ted FriedmanHundreds of people showed up to march on the UC Berkeley campus Saturday in what turned out to be a fake protest organized by a prankster who later identified himself (perhaps falsely) as a Russian national. But the march went on anyway.\nA person named Sam Cox listed a march on the Action Network website that was to start at Memorial Glade near Doe Library at UC Berkeley at noon. He also cross-listed the march on the Women's March Bay Area website, although the listing was later taken down. Berkeleyside got an email Thursday about the march and added it to the already-published story listing activities taking place Saturday in response to the inauguration.\nBut when hundreds of people showed up to Memorial Glade, there was no organized march. And those who had registered online later got an email in Russian stating:\n\"Ia pranked mnogikh amerikantsev! khakhakha / Ne udivitel'no, chto liudi ne imeiut stol' nizkie rezul'taty testov. i odin iz vas poluchili eto pravo, chto ia russkii natsional'nyi xaxaxaxa / Do svidaniia!\"\n\nTranslated, that means: \"I pranked many Americans! Hahaha. Not surprising that people [do] don't have such low test scores and one of you got this right/privilege that I am Russian national. ha ha haha. Goodbye!\"\nAnd the name of the organizer of the march was changed on the website from Sam Cox to \"Pepe the Frog,\" a meme recently appropriated by the racist right. The Anti-Defamation League added the frog meme into its database of symbols in 2016.\n\"The event page now has a frog giving the finger because the 'organizer' assumed we would get there, find no one, and look it up to make sure we were in the correct spot, and get the finger,\" Cori Kesler, one of the Berkeley marchers, told Berkeleyside.\nMaris Meyerson was one of the hundreds who turned up at Memorial Glade to join the march. By around 11:45 a.m., when no organizer had turned up, she and others began to be suspicious, she said. Other marchers reported that when they clicked on \"Memorial Grove,\" the website said the location was closed. That led many people to wander around campus, frustrated by not knowing where to go, said Meyerson.\n\"A bunch of us were RSVPing for a march that was put together by Pepe the Frog,\" said Meyerson. \"They were trying to draw people away from Oakland to bring the numbers down.... It was clearly someone trying to make you reach a dead end.\"\nDespite the fact that UC Berkeley protest march was organized by a prankster, the hundreds who gathered organized their own march on Saturday starting at Doe Library. Photo: Ted FriedmanPepe the Frog, however, must not be familiar with Berkeley protesters. As soon as those gathered realized the march was a fake with no real organizer, they led their own march. Hundreds walked through campus but avoided city streets since they did not have a permit, said Meyerson.\n\"We overcame the prank,\" she said. \"We were not deterred.\"\n\"As noon approached at the entrance to Doe Library, a couple of women stood up and spoke to the crowd (without a mike, so not easy to hear), to let them know they were not the organizers, but were stepping up to get things going,\" Rachel Bradley wrote Berkeleyside. \"Everyone was full of energy and ready to march, so we proceeded along the path described by the self-appointed leaders (through Sather Gate, down Bancroft, along Oxford to the west entrance to UC, they back up to Doe Library), chanting, waving signs, and generally acting like the protesters we all came there to be.\"\nAnother participant told Berkeleyside, \"In spite of its dubious origins, I'd estimate that nearly a thousand people showed up for the spur-of-the-moment event, which the speakers admitted was leaderless. In my opinion it was nevertheless fairly uplifting.\"\nSaid Kesler, \"We walked through campus and down Hearst and around Oxford and then back to where we began at Memorial Glade. Upon return it was apparent that our group had more than doubled and someone had run home to bring their personal amplifier so we could continue the march with chants, speeches, and song. The man who supplied the amplifier ended our demonstration by singing a gorgeous and rousing rendition of Man of LaMancha's THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM.\"\nNicole Pagano also described that song to Berkeleyside as \"gorgeous,\" adding, \" I'll never forget it.\"\nPagano said she too felt the demonstration became, \"a beautiful expression of our country's values.... But there was also a strange drone flying peripatetically around the scene. I couldn't help but wonder who was commandeering it, and where its footage would appear.\"\nSome people never found the march, however, and were disappointed.\n\"We never found the meeting place!\" a woman named Shirley wrote on the Shadilay discussion board. \"No signs to show us. I feel bad about never locating the March. We encountered a number of others who never found it either. So disappointing.\"\nThose who called the number listed on the event website were disappointed, too, as the number was fake. It belongs to a San Leandro man who said he has gotten about 60 to 80 calls in the last week asking for details about the UC Berkeley march. The man, who did not want to be identified, told people he could not help them and they had the wrong number.\nShortly after the march began Saturday, those who had registered (the website say 945 people RSVP'd) started to get emails with information supporting President Trump. The prankster, who was clearly monitoring the discussion boards, posted that he had the last laugh because he had captured hundreds of emails.\n\"Maris dear, I still got the: names, addresses, and email addresses of hundreds of people,\" the organizer posted. \"So who really got pranked?\"\nBerkeleyside reached out via twitter to ask for a translation of the Russian message, and many readers responded. All commented that the grammar of the note was strange, leading some to say it was not written by anyone who spoke Russian fluently.\n\"There are clear grammatical errors here and it seems like this wasn't written by a native Russian speaker,\" Sergey Mann, a Russian native who is now the vice president of communications for the Berkeley Forum, wrote to Berkeleyside. \"In fact, it was likely translated into Russian using Google translate.\"\nDespite the fact the once-fake march was a success, Meyerson said she was disturbed by the incident.\n\"It's an unnerving feeling to think someone had 'gotten' you,\" she said. \"It was unsettling and I had an unsettled night. It does not matter if it was a Russian national or an American jerk, it's not a pleasant feeling.\"\nBerkeleyans who showed up to what turned out to be a fake protest took matters into their own hands.

At around 1:15 p.m., BHS Vice-Principal Erin Schweng sent out an email to the BHS community to say at lunchtime, \"a group of about 200 students peacefully marched from BHS up to UC Berkeley.\" She said two administrators had accompanied the students, and the school had been in communication with the police to \"provide a clear, traffic-free path for their route.\" She said by halfway through the fourth period, \"the great majority\" of students were back in classes for the afternoon.\nDaniel Cardozo told us via Twitter that he had heard 100 students had walked off an Albany school campus.\nOne reader said some roads were blocked off near the Cal campus.\n\nAround 1 p.m., Karina Ioffee of the East Bay Times reported via Twitter that the protesters planned to march to Oakland. Oakland Police issued a Nixle alert at 1:47 p.m. stating that \"a large group of demonstrators are anticipated to march from Berkeley down Telegraph Avenue to Frank Ogawa Plaza.\" OPD advised drivers use alternate routes, and use caution and approach with slow speeds.\nBerkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin released a statement around 1:30 p.m. about the country's new president. Expressing the hope that Berkeley continue to be \"a beacon of light during dark times,\" he wrote: \"In his inaugural address, President Trump called upon building unity and providing a voice to those who have become forgotten. But this cannot be done through mass deportations that break apart families, or continuing the mass incarceration of minorities, stripping them of their rights.\" And he concluded: \"As we begin this new chapter in American history, we must be vigilant and raise our voice to ensure that our future is written by we the people, and not an elite handful of billionaires.\"\nThis developing story continues to be updated after publication.\nBerkeley High students march along Kittredge St. after leaving their campus to join protest on Friday, Jan. 20.

Photo: Sam KohnThe election of Donald J. Trump as ppppppp... president of the United States has sent much of Berkeley into a frenzy of resistance unseen here probably since the 1960s. If the New York Times is correct in calling the state of California a \"laboratory of resistance\" to the Trump agenda, then Berkeley could be called the front burner of that resistance lab. (Although the city is certainly not without competition.)\nAt least a dozen local groups started meeting and organizing against Trump right after the November election, sometimes in people's living rooms, but also in bars and churches. Everyone, it seems, wants to do something. Awareness of these group spreads partly by old-fashioned word of mouth -- there are at least two groups of \"70s feminists\" who have known each other for decades -- and partly by social media, which brings total strangers together.\nUnlike in the 1960s, Facebook has been a major organizing force for this particular revolution. One group in central Berkeley was promoted on NextDoor. And national websites created by former political operatives for the Obama and Clinton campaigns have also served as portals where groups can list themselves and attract members.\nLike all popular movements, this one is starting with a fair amount of chaos. The national websites were put together quickly-- Trump was not supposed to win! -- and many of the organizing details are not yet worked out.\n\nEveryone in these groups agrees on the overarching goal: defeat Trumpism and win back the red states in 2018 and 2020. In other words, make America Democratic again. But how to get there? What kind of Democratic candidates should be supported?, the groups are asking. Do groups want to support \"corporate\" candidates (as some people refer to Hillary Clinton), or candidates more in the mold of Bernie Sanders or Paul Wellstone?\nAnd what should the primary focus be? Defeating the Trump agenda, or recruiting new Democratic candidates for the upcoming elections? What can people living in ultra-blue districts such as Berkeley do? Should Berkeleyans reach out to friends and relative in red states and offer to support them as they recruit and run Democratic candidates, or should the path be following the Democratic Party script and supporting candidates that they pick out and promote? And what about our own Congressional delegation: are they doing enough to defeat the Trump Cabinet nominees? Why are California's two Senators attending the inauguration, rather than boycotting it like 60 other members of Congress?\nAll these questions (and many others) are being debated with some passion at group meetings every day of the week in Berkeley, home of the Free Speech Movement. And while there is consensus on the larger goals, there is often less consensus regarding specific tactics and the nuts and bolts of where each group should put its energy.\nSo what does the current \"revolution\" look like? This reporter spent much of the past 10 days trying to find out, attending meetings, trainings and gatherings. Spirits among attendees were high, but many of the group leaders were still defining what it is they want their group to focus on; several have begun reaching out to others in an effort to reduce duplication and increase effectiveness. Two groups have already merged into one. All the groups are volunteer-run at the moment, and many people have full- or part-time jobs. Burn-out is a real concern.\nBelow is a travel guide to some -- but far from all -- corners of the movement. We begin with one-time events and happenings -- such as a five-minute \"banging of pots and pans\" and Berkeley Rep's \"Ghostlight Project\" -- as well as an anti-inauguration Blue Ball and three Women's Marches.\nWe continue through a sample (incomplete) listing of groups that are meeting in and around Berkeley and planning years-long efforts to defeat Trumpism. (The largest of these movements, called Indivisible, urges people on the Left to use the same tactics the Tea Party used, but this time to move their Congressional representatives further to the left.) And finally, we list some national websites that provide organizing tools and suggestions for local grassroots groups.\nONE-TIME, INAUGURATION-RELATED EVENTS(In chronological order)\nBe A Light: The GhostLight ProjectThe Ghostlight ProjectJan. 19, 5:30 p.m.\nBerkeley Rep, Narsai M. David Courtyard\n2025 Addison St. (Check if your favorite theater is participating.)\nLocal theaters including Berkeley Rep, Shotgun Players and Berkeley Playhouse, are joining over 100 theaters and theatrical organizations nationwide in launching The Ghostlight Project, a collective, simultaneous action, creating \"light\" for challenging times ahead. Inspired by the tradition of leaving a ghost light on in a darkened theater, artists and communities will make or renew a pledge to stand for and protect the values of inclusion, participation, and compassion for everyone. There will be a short program followed by the ceremonial lighting. This event is free of charge, and members of the community are invited to bring an electric light, flashlight, an electric candle, or smartphone.\nThe Banging of the PotsFriday, Jan. 20 from 6-6:05 p.m.\nEverywhere\nOn Inauguration Day, Berkeleyans are invited to go out into the streets and bang pots and pans for five minutes in keeping with the Central and South American tradition of Cacerolazo, which registers protest against the government by banging pots and utensils.\nThe Blue Ball takes place at HOME on Treasure Island on Friday Jan. 20. Photo: HOMEThe Blue Ball: Inauguration Day, Friday, Jan. 20 from 8:00 to 11:00 p.m.\nCall it the anti-inauguration ball: \"Did the election leave you unsatisfied? Commiserate, activate, donate.\" The event is at Home on Treasure Island (free parking). Tickets are $75 and cover food and drinks. Attendees are expected to donate to specific charities while at the event. You can also donate to those charities on-line, without purchasing a ticket.

We are more active and have more participants on-line, where we post actions we want others to join in on. Some efforts take a few minutes, others take a little more effort, like communicating directly with members of Congress. Those who send or fax letters, or make calls, often post a templates or scripts for others to follow. In the future, we plan to participate in actions that will be even more effective and will require greater contribution of time and energy.

Information about these races is hard to find, and busy people don't have the time to sift through it.\" The site offers to help.\nIt was founded by \"a team of organizers, politics junkies, strategists, and engineers who met each other working on the Hillary Clinton campaign in Columbus, Ohio and Brooklyn, New York. We come from a variety of worlds - international development, consulting, tech, and social enterprise. But we were united by the profoundly moving experience of working on the campaign, and a resolve never to let Nov. 9, 2016 happen again.\"\nIndivisible GuideThis site was created by former congressional staffers who \"reveal the best practices for making Congress listen.\" They wrote a \"practical guide for resisting the Trump agenda:\" The guide teaches those on the Left the tactics that made the Tea Party so successful. In other words, the guide shows how small groups of citizens can use very strategic actions to influence Congressional representatives to move to the left (in this case.) This guide is a good place to start if you want to create a new group or find a group in another zip code altogether.\n Living Room ConversationsThis site is different from the others listed here since it's non-partisan and aims to build consensus around \"cross-over\" issues that can unite people of different political persuasions after this divisive election. The site offers simple guidelines for holding civil conversations on numerous social and political hot-button issues. This group is founded by Berkeley resident Joan Blades, the co-founder of MoveOn.org.\nLiving Room Conversations is now working with another group called www.hifromtheotherside.com, which also matches people across the political divide. (Living Room Conversations tries to get groups of six people together, to keep things civil and to give support to people on each side. Hi From the Other Side creates one-on-one conversations on-line.)\nRebuild the HopeThis is a huge and resource-rich site created by alumni of the Organizing for Action (originally Organizing for Obama) team. It has all kinds of forms and tools that make it easy to run grassroots meetings and campaigns and saves activists from having to re-invent the wheel. That said, this group is very tied in to the Democratic Party establishment. Those who feel the Bern or belong to the Wellstone Club may want to look elsewhere for candidates (although the organizing tools here are still very useful).\nThe Sister District ProjectFounded by four Bay Area attorneys, this site intends to \"pair red districts with blue districts for a bluer tomorrow.\" The site says \"if you live in a safe blue or red district, your economic and volunteer resources can be channeled to a swing district that needs your help. We can change the map together.\" You can sign up to help on the site now, but the red-blue connections are not yet functional.\nWall-of-usTwo Berkeley women, Amelia Miazad and Kara Ganter, created Wall-of-us \"To make it simply irresistible for Americans to become active participants in rebuilding our democracy.\" The group describes itself as \"the largest daily action site out there\" and has brought together suggested \"weekly acts\" and other ways to participate, including an inauguration day oath.

It sits behind a chain-link fence. Photo: Google MapsOn a chilly night last week, a quiet line of about a dozen people stood at the gate of Berkeley's new Second Street homeless shelter, waiting for the 7 p.m. open. Most were bundled in coats; some carried large suitcases and bags, others nothing at all.\n\"This is one of the best ones [shelters] for me; the people are nice and I feel secure,\" said an older woman who didn't want to provide her name. She, like many staying on Second Street that night, has been a regular there since it opened Dec. 23.\nThe shelter, located at 1231 Second St. near I-80 between Gilman Street and the Albany border, has storage space for bulky personal belongings, locking bike racks, and kennels for pet dogs -- steps taken to address some of the reasons people give for not using shelters. Surrounded by a chain-link fence, the city-owned, single-story flat-roofed building used to house public-works employees.\nPeople filtered in for the next hour, arriving by car, bike and foot.\n\nIn mid-December, under direction from the City Council, the city established an emergency operations center to oversee stepped-up efforts to expand winter-shelter space, establish daytime warming centers and offer other services for those without homes. This action was among the first orders of business of new Mayor Jesse Arreguin, who took office with a pledge to address homelessness as a top priority.\nSecond Street was a direct response.\nIncreasing the number of winter beds, removing obstacles to shelter use, such as allowing dogs, providing transportation to shelters, and increasing outreach to connect people living on the streets to services were among the steps set in motion by the City Council.\nWhile so far no-one has brought a canine companion to Second Street, the city feels it's on the right track and will continue to look for ways to get people sheltered and ultimately into permanent housing, which is the longer term goal, said city spokesman Matthai Chakko.\n\"City staff are doing what we can... we can't force people to take advantage of it,\" Chakko said. \"We're trying to do everything we can to reduce barriers; that's what we can control. We can give people chances to make choices in their life, but ultimately, it's their choice.\"\nA number of homeless people have pitched tents on Fourth Street and University Avenue, under the I-80 overpass. Photo: Kate RauchThis was evident last week on University Avenue near Fourth Street at a popular homeless spot under the freeway overpass where one could see several tents, makeshift shelters and bedrolls.\nThough located about a mile from the Second Street shelter, many at the sidewalk encampment said they had no interest in the accommodation, even those with dogs. \"They [shelters] haven't worked for me,\" said Missy, a woman living in a sidewalk tent with her boyfriend and dog, Baby Girl, a pit bull or pit bull mix.\nMissy, who grew up in Berkeley, and who has been homeless since getting out of jail about a year ago, said she doesn't like dealing with people in close quarters, such as at shelters. She's saving for an apartment, she said.\nThe same went for Kimble Welch, whose bedroll was a few yards from Missy. Welch, who grew up in Santa Cruz, has been homeless for about 20 years, which he attributes to alcoholism. His small terrier-looking pooch, Paxi, was curled up in a bed of blankets near his feet.\nWelch said he'd never stay in a shelter. There are \"a lot of personality conflicts,\" he said. He likes being homeless in Berkeley because \"the cops are nice,\" he said.\nBerkeley's shelter system includes a mix of year-round and winter shelters for a current capacity of about 278 people, 148 permanent beds, and an additional 130 in winter.\nPhoto: Ted FriedmanRead more about homelessness in Berkeley, including Berkeleyside's award-winning Berkeley Homeless Project package.\nThe city contracts with nonprofit organizations to run its shelters. Dorothy Day House operates the winter shelters, which open based on the weather, namely how cold it is or whether it's raining.\nThe year-round shelters are usually full, said Kristen Lee, the city's manager of housing and community services. Occupancy at the winter shelters, including Second Street, varies night by night but has ranged from 50% to 75% for the past few weeks, with greater use recently during the heavy rains, according to city data.\nIn addition to Second Street, which is open nightly and can accommodate 47 people, a second winter shelter is operated on a rotating basis at the North Berkeley Senior Center, the First Presbyterian Church and the Frances Albrier Community Center. Each of these can accommodate 65 people.\nHours are generally 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., except at First Presbyterian, which opens at 10 p.m.\nThe city is working with other churches and community sites to add to the rotating shelter, seeking locations that don't have evening events or activities that affect when people can bed down for the night, Lee said. \"It's better for everyone; sometimes consumers can't get in until 10 p.m.\"\nThe fixed location of Second Street makes it a welcome alternative to the rotating shelter, said Melissa Hanson, 77, who was among those settling in for the night last week. \"So we know where we are going every day,\" she said. \"I feel safe, there's a light on all the time.\"\nHanson, who said she's lived in her car and on the streets, said she's on waiting lists in several cities for senior housing.\nAfter signing-in, shelter clients gathered sleeping pads, clean sheets and sleeping bags, choosing their spots on the white concrete floor in small side rooms or the main common area. Many knew each other; some helped first-timers. Before 8 p.m., many were resting in their beds.\nBerkeley's homeless program, organized through a coordinated entry system called The Hub, is focused on supported permanent housing, prioritizing the chronically homeless and disabled.

Rendering: Solomon Cordwell BuenzThe Pacific School of Religion and Mather LifeWays have decided to withdraw their application to build 265 apartments for seniors on Holy Hill.\nPSR and the Illinois-based nonprofit builder said \"changes in the local political landscape\" led to the decision.\n\"While both organizations believe in the significant benefits the community would have provided to the City of Berkeley, changes in the local political landscape have increased uncertainty regarding the project,\" according to a statement released jointly by the two organizations.\nRead more about Holy Hill and its proposed development, on Berkeleyside.The November election ushered in a development-skeptical City Council majority and a new mayor, Jesse Arreguin, who campaigned on the promise to extract more in community benefits from developers than the previous mayor and council did. Arreguin's opponent for the mayoral seat, former City Councilman Laurie Capitelli, had predicted that Arreguin's election would lead to less development.\n\nPSR and Mather LifeWays had proposed a \"continuing care\" facility that featured apartments, a memory care unit, and nursing facilities for people at the end of their lives. Some of the seniors would have been housed in 5- to 6-story buildings on PSR's main campus along Scenic Avenue. The complex would also have included the construction of a string of three-story high, Mediterranean-style buildings along Virginia Avenue.\nThere has been opposition to the plan from the time the two groups announced their intentions in August 2016. A number of neighbors formed the group, Save Holy Hill, to fight off the development, which they called out of scale and out of character with the residential neighborhood. The group said the complex was being built for the \"very wealthy,\" not ordinary seniors, and would destroy too many old and architecturally significant buildings on the PSR campus. It would also destroy prized open space in the middle of the city, they said.\n\"Our mission is to stop this massive development from being built as proposed,\" reads the Save Holy Hill website.... This project is wrong for Berkeley.\"\nDaniella Thompson, a preservationist and past president of the Berkeley Architectural Association, has been leading tours through the bucolic PSR campus to drum up opposition to the $400 million project.\n\"This is a scorched-earth campaign,\" Thompson said when the project was first announced. \"They want to demolish everything and start from scratch... It's a nice idea to provide senior housing, but this is demolishing wholesale a whole neighborhood. It's horrible. It's terrible.\"\nMather LifeWays and PSR had argued that the project would fill a need. About 25% of Berkeley property owners are older than 55 and many professors from PSR, other schools affiliated with the Graduate Theological Union, and UC Berkeley move out of Berkeley after they retire because there are no senior centers to move into. The new complex would have provided them a place to live, according to the two groups.\nThe project also would have benefited Berkeley by returning tax-exempt land to the tax rolls, the groups said.\nAn overview of the current campus of the Pacific School of Religion on Holy Hill. Photo: Chris BentonThe Pacific School of Religion sought a partnership with Mather LifeWays because its campus is underutilized, according to David Vasquez-Levy, president of the Pacific School of Religion. The campus, constructed on the old model of seminary study, has evolved, In the 1940s and 1950s, mostly male students would come to PSR to live and study for three years. Then they would then go off and lead a congregation, he said.\nToday, fewer students live on campus. Instead, they come for classes and leave. The institution has been discussing what to do with its campus for about 10 years, he said.\nWhile the deal with Mather LifeWays is off, PSR will still seek to develop portions of the land, according to the statement. PSR is in discussions with potential buyers and expects to announce next steps in the coming months.\n\"Given the changes in our educational programs, we do not fully utilize all of the property we own,\" said Vasquez-Levy. \"Our intent is to leverage our real estate property towards a partnership that will strengthen our financial ability to fulfill our mission to prepare theologically and spiritually rooted leaders for social transformation within and beyond the church.\"\nThe Save Holy Hill group said it recognizes that the PSR property will be developed one day but said the neighbors should play a larger part in the planning process.\nSome people in the community have speculated that the campus would be a good place for UC Berkeley to build more housing for its students. If Cal developed the property it would not have to comply with local zoning laws since it is a state agency. Cal would have to go through the CEQA process, however, which requires community input, according to Christine Shaff, the communications director for Cal's Real Estate Division.\nHowever, UC Berkeley has no plans to acquire the PSR campus, said Shaff.\n \n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "Plan to build apartments on Holy Hill dies due to 'changes in local political landscape'", "Tags": "['Berkeley development', 'Daniella Thompson', 'Holy Hill', 'Mather Lifeways', 'Pacific School of Religion']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Real Estate', 'Schools']", "Natural Language Location": "Holy Hill", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.876242", "Zip Code": "94709", "ID": "244358", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.26065", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/01/13/controversial-plan-build-265-apartments-holy-hill-dies/", "Author": "Frances Dinkelspiel", "Date": "2017-01-13T07:00:52-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "There is a proposal pending to add an illuminated Skydeck sign at the top of 2150 Shattuck Ave. Not everyone is happy about the idea. Rendering: Ad ArtUpdate: The illuminated lighting will go forward.  The Design Review Committee voted 4 to 1 on Jan. 18 to reject Steve Finacom's appeal.\nOriginal story: The top of the tower at 2150 Shattuck Ave. has been branded since the 1990s, first with Powerbar, the name of the energy bar company, and then Chase, the name of a bank.\nNow a new group wants to put up an illuminated sign that says Skydeck, referring to the UC Berkeley incubator space that occupies the building's penthouse. But a long-time preservationist is fighting the plan because he believes the sign is prohibited under Berkeley law. Plus, he is concerned that the sign might lead others - including, potentially, President-elect Donald Trump - to advertise their businesses on new towers that are about to be built in Berkeley.\n\"The skyline of Downtown could be festooned with lighted advertising signs that will be as prominent on the Berkeley skyline as the Campanile,\" Steve Finacom wrote in an article in the Daily Planet.\n\nFinacom is appealing a city staff decision to permit the Skydeck sign. The Design Review Committee is scheduled to discuss the appeal next Thursday, Jan. 19.\nAd Art submitted a proposal in September asking to put up two Skydeck signs on a rooftop enclosure that holds the building's mechanical and electrical equipment. There would be one sign on the south side of the building with letters four feet high, and one on the east side of the building with letters three feet high, according to staff reports. The signs would either be neon or LED.\nCity staff approved the signage on Nov. 1, with certain restrictions. The signs had to have dimmers, they had to be turned off from midnight to 6 a.m., and staff would be able to revisit the project after six months.\nThe Skydeck sign as it would be seen in the daytime. Rendering: Ad ArtCity staff concluded that the proposed signs were \"consistent with Title 20 of the Berkeley Municipal Code (signs) and the Downtown Berkeley guidelines as overall building signage in terms of size, the number of signs allowed, and illumination.\"\nFinacom has argued that staff is ignoring other provisions, such as the requirement that signs on the upper facade of a building be building identification signs only. Skydeck is a tenant of 2150 Shattuck Ave., and is not the name of the building so it should not be allowed to have its name on the top, he said.\nSteve Finacom said if the Skydeck sign is approved, what is there to prevent someone like Donald Trump from coming in and putting his name on one of the two 180-feet buildings that the City Council recently approved?In addition, Berkeley law requires signs to be on the facades of buildings, not their roofs, Finacom wrote in his appeal. The Skydeck sign would be attached to a metal casing surrounding the equipment on the roof, not the facade, he said.\nMoreover, the Downtown Berkeley Design Guidelines discourage the use of company names on taller buildings, said Finacom, who included this graph from the guidelines in his appeal:\n\"Architecture, not advertising, should define the upper elevations of buildings, especially those visible from beyond the Downtown. Commercial signage, advertising signage (including emblems or logos) or building name signage should be avoided on adjacent to the roofs of buildings downtown.\"\nFinacom said if the Skydeck sign is approved, what is there to prevent someone like Donald Trump from coming in and putting his name on one of the two 180-feet buildings that the City Council recently approved?\n\"Under the current signage interpretations of staff, Berkeley would have no recourse but to allow a big, illuminated sign across the top of the building reading \"TRUMP TOWER - BERKELEY,\" Finacom wrote.\n(There is no indication that Trump is interested in doing this.)\nSteven Donaldson, a marketing consultant who has been volunteering his time the last seven months to get the sign authorized, said that SkyDeck is not a commercial business but a non-profit entity run by UC.\n\"The intent of this sign is to brand Berkeley as a center of innovation - not commercially advertise for a for-profit business, this is a very, very different use than the Chase sign, Power Bar sign or the current WeWork sign,\" Donaldson said in an email.\nDonaldson also said that the letters would be made up on LED lights, not neon, although that information is not included in the city staff reports.\nIn response to Finacom's comments, city staff is now recommending that the illuminated signs be turned off at 11 p.m. every night rather than midnight. But staff argues that the proposed signage is compliant with Berkeley law and should be approved. Both the Powerbar and Chase signs were located at the rooftop level, and not on the facade, according to a staff report. And the design guidelines presented in the Downtown Berkeley Design Guidelines were never incorporated into Berkeley's City Sign Ordinance and do not apply, according to the report.\nRead the sign proposal and Steve Finacom's appeal.\nEditors' note: This story was updated at 10:15 p.m. to add Donaldson's comments.

I grew up blocks from 924 Gilman, but by the time I went to my first show there in 1999, it was apparent that I'd missed the golden age of East Bay punk by five to 15 years, depending on whom I asked.\nLuckily, there are history books -- though I don't expect the ones being feted this Saturday, Jan. 7 at The Lookout! Bookout! Bash at the Berkeley Public Library's North Berkeley Branch to appear on standardized high-school reading lists anytime soon.\n\nFeaturing appearances by Lookout Records founder Larry Livermore, Pansy Division's Jon Ginoli, Mr. T Experience's Frank Portman,  Juke's Nick Wolfinger, and the Smugglers' Grant Lawrence, this afternoon event is an aptly named celebration of books about Bay Area punk. It also serves as the literary component to The Lookouting, a four-day festival celebrating the 30th anniversary of 924 Gilman via a slew of bands affiliated with Lookout Records in the early '90s.\n\nOne benefit of waiting 30-odd years to wax poetic on a scene is, apparently, that several of its central figures have actually authored books -- and in at least one case, have gone on to legit literary careers. MTX's Portman, or Dr. Frank, has made a second name for himself as a novelist, with his well-received King Dork series.\nRead more about The Lookouting, a celebration of Lookout Records.\nAnd hey, nothing like the best of both worlds: If an afternoon at the library leaves you feeling a little tame, both he and Ginoli (whose memoir Deflowered: My Life in Pansy Division chronicles his experiences with the groundbreaking queer punk band) will also perform later in the evening, with full bands, at Gilman -- the all-ages club where, despite what nostalgia might tell you, the party is absolutely still going strong.\nThis story first appeared on KQED Arts on Jan. 5, 2017.\nWant to know what else is going on in Berkeley and nearby?

He opened Pizzaiolo on Telegraph Avenue in the Temescal neighborhood in 2005, and followed up a few years later with Boot & Shoe Service and Penrose, both on Grand Avenue in Oakland. All are rooted in Mediterranean cuisine, with the first two focused on Italian fare and pizzas, while Penrose's menu leans towards North-African flavors. It's a fair guess that Berkeley's Boot & Shoe will offer wood-fired pizzas as well as a selection of antipasti and pasta dishes, if the Oakland spot's current dinner menu is a template.\nHotel developers Lisa and David Holt poured time and money into rehabbing the 1906 Morse Block building on the corner of Shattuck and Bancroft to open a spacious, 'build-your-own pizza' restaurant there in 2013. At the time, they said their intention was to roll out more Build spots once they had bedded down the Berkeley restaurant. They also transformed the building's basement-level club, Shattuck Down Low, into nightclub and music venue  Berkeley Underground. However neither venture was ultimately successful. The Holts sold their interest in Build's holding company, Rustic Restaurants, to the Moana Restaurant Group, and then, in October 2015, filed for bankruptcy.\nHallowell's lease includes the 8,000 sq ft basement as well as the restaurant space, but, as yet, he has not decided how he will use it, according to Roemmer.\n\"We have taken over the whole space, including the venue space, but have no plans for the downstairs as of now, including a name,\" she said.\nThe restaurant and nightclub space have sat empty since spring 2015.\nHallowell cooked at Chez Panisse before opening Pizzaiolo, and his restaurants are grounded in the Alice Waters ethos of seasonal, responsibly sourced ingredients prepared well. They all seem to have hit the sweet spot, proving popular with diners and garnering favorable reviews. The restaurateur is also known for his support of nonprofits and local community initiatives, regularly holding fundraisers for causes he believes in, such as the Sunday Supper series at Pizzaiolo.\nKlein said downtown Berkeley was increasingly being known for its restaurants as well as for its theater, music and comedy venues. He said spots like Comal, Ippuku and Gather are drawing people from around the region.\n\"Charlie's project will be a great addition to that list. And the space on Shattuck is perfect for him,\" he said.\nAccording to Klein, the signing of the 2286 Shattuck Ave. lease brings the storefront commercial vacancy rate in downtown Berkeley down to about 4%, the lowest it has been in the ten years since the Office of Economic Development started tracking this data.\nBoot & Shoe Service Berkeley will be at 2286 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley.

Many of the murals depicted in Tom Dalzell's April 11 Quirky Berkeley story, she told us, were created as part of the inaugural Bay Area Mural Festival in October last year.\nThe festival (BAMFest) brought together 25 master muralists and mural groups, and 20 at-risk youth through a series of artist residencies and workshops, culminating in the creation of 13 murals along the Berkeley-Oakland border.\nRead more about Berkeley murals.\nThe murals depicted locally relevant migration and displacement stories, and were painted over the course of a week beginning on Oct. 17. The festival culminated with a community celebration with live music. An accompanying BAMFest lecture series took place at La Pena Cultural Center, a festival partner.\nWriting about the project, Siskin said murals are important \"because they bring art into the public sphere and attract public attention to social issues... Whether it be social emancipation or achieving a political goal, murals give a voice to the often voiceless, they can challenge the effects of displacement and the demands of a global market by allowing us to become actors in our own realities. They can be the necessary catalyst to motivate us to make real change.\"\nSiskin is hoping to hold another Bay Area Mural Festival this year.

Photo: Courtesy UC TheatreIn April last year, after seven years of struggle and a number of last-minute hiccups, the UC Theatre finally reopened in downtown Berkeley as a 1,400-seat live music venue. One year on, after 54 concerts, the venue celebrates its first anniversary with a series of performances ranging from ska and reggae legends Toots and the Maytals and Balkan Beat Box to The Zombies (which founder and CEO David Mayeri says is \"our Summer of Love foreplay concert\").\n\"The highlight was getting it open and just watching the audience and the artists who perform -- how they've just come to embrace it and talked about how much they love the room,\" Mayeri said, reflecting on the venue's first year.\nThe venue is also celebrating its centennial this year, having been saved from dereliction by Mayeri's years-long efforts. Former owner Landmark Theatres closed the UC Theatre in 2001, rather than invest in a needed seismic upgrade. The venue had been famous, among other things, for showing Rocky Horror Picture Show weekly for 22 consecutive years. It originally opened in June 1917 as a first-run theater, named after, but having no direct relation to the nearby UC Berkeley.  \nMayeri raised the money for the $6.8 million transformation of the building, establishing the UC Theatre as a nonprofit, community-minded music venue. The group's budget is two-thirds funded from ticket sales and one-third from donors, Mayeri said.\n\nBilly Joe Armstrong from Green Day performing at the UC Theatre in October 2016. Photo: Kelly Owen\"This is a gem in our downtown,\" said Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin, presenting a city proclamation celebrating the first anniversary to Mayeri last Saturday. He made a particular point of noting Mayeri's efforts. \"He doggedly, and I really mean doggedly, pursued this vision.\"\nAccording to Mayeri, artists who have performed at the UC Theatre have been unanimous in their praise for its acoustic qualities. The venue has a Leopard system from Berkeley-based Meyer Sound, which Mayeri said is optimized for rock music. They are installing a Meyer Sound Constellation system as well -- although the nonprofit has to raise a further $600,000 to fund that -- which will improve the sound for acoustic music.\nThe UC Theatre has been an important element in the continuing efforts to add new vitality to Berkeley's downtown, said John Caner, CEO of the Downtown Berkeley Association. The UC Theatre is the largest of the new music venues downtown. But the last year has also seen the opening of the intimate Back Room and the mid-sized Cornerstone.\nThe UC TheatreFacebook / TwitterInstagram / YouTube\"It's expanded the demographic appeal of the arts district,\" Caner said. \"It's a younger audience and it's more towards rock 'n' roll and contemporary music. I think it's also a linchpin for the revitalization of University Avenue, where we now have Tender Greens, Berkeley Social Club, and, soon, Stonefire.\"\nMayeri said that between 30-40% of ticket buyers come from Berkeley and Oakland, which is higher than he anticipated.\n\"They love having this world-class music venue in town,\" he said, adding that the experience of its first year positions the UC Theatre well going forward.\n\"Our show calendar is increasing,\" he said. \"We have to earn the reputation that this is a room that an agent and a manager will trust to have their band in. That process takes a little longer than we would have hoped. Our reputation is growing.\"\nThe UC Theatre is also taking seriously its nonprofit role in the community, notably with its Concert Careers Pathways program to train young people aged 17-25 in the technical, creative and business aspects of concert and event promotion. The UC Theatre works with local groups like Berkeley Youth Alternatives, the Center for Independent Living and the Berkeley YMCA Teen Center to find candidates for the program. After completing the program, the youths enter into paid internships at the UC Theatre.\n\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "One year in, the UC Theatre has made its mark as Berkeley music venue", "Tags": "['Berkeley music', 'UC Theatre']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts']", "Natural Language Location": "UC Theatre", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.871888", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "254170", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.269829", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/04/12/one-year-uc-theatre-made-mark-berkeley-music-venue/", "Author": "Lance Knobel", "Date": "2017-04-12T14:39:31-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Left: Henri Matisse, Femme au chapeau (Woman with a Hat), 1905; oil on canvas; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, bequest of Elise S.

Right: Richard Diebenkorn, Seated Figure with Hat, 1967; oil on canvas; National Gallery of Art, Washington,D.C., gift of the Collectors Committee and Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Rubin; (c) the Richard Diebenkorn FoundationRichard Diebenkorn had strong ties to Berkeley. But home-boy pride is only one compelling reason to see SFMOMA's Matisse / Diebenkorn exhibition, a radiant, revelatory show, tracing the deep, life-long impact of French modernist artist Henri Matisse (1869-1954) on a major American artist over 50 years his junior, whom he never met.\nRichard Diebenkorn (1922-1993) was a Bay Area native. Born and raised in San Francisco, he studied art at Stanford, UC Berkeley and the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute). With a faculty that included Clyfford Still, Elmer Bischoff, David Park, Mark Rothko, Ad Reinhardt and Diebenkorn himself, CSFA was a hub for Abstract Expressionism in the 1940s and 50s. Ab Ex was then the dominant U.S. painting style, and Diebenkorn's early work was entirely in that mode.\nThat began to change in 1953, when Diebenkorn and his wife, Phyllis, moved (after a brief, unhappy sojourn in Urbana, Illinois) back to Berkeley, where they lived and raised their two children. Influenced by Berkeley-based artist friends, including Bischoff and Park -- who, as renegades from the prevailing Ab Ex orthodoxy, were exploring representation in their paintings and in regular life-drawing sessions -- Diebenkorn's artistic practice shifted radically.\nIn Berkeley, Diebenkorn became a prominent exponent of the Bay Area figurative style. His prolific output of interiors opening onto the outdoors, seated female figures, landscapes, still lifes and quasi-abstract aerial views of East Bay terrain, suffused with nuanced Bay Area light and rich complex colors, were sumptuously displayed in Richard Diebenkorn: The Berkeley Years, 1953-1966, an exhibition organized by Timothy Burgard at the de Young Museum in 2013.\n\nDiebenkorn's move to Southern California in 1967 signaled another stylistic about-face. Living in the Ocean Park neighborhood of Santa Monica, and inspired by LA's raking light and pastel colors, he embarked upon a flattened, geometric form of abstraction with his luminous signature works, the Ocean Park series.\nLeft: Henri Matisse, Notre Dame, A Late Afternoon, 1902; oil on paper mounted on canvas; Collection Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York, gift of Seymour H.

Richard Diebenkorn died in Berkeley in 1993. His daughter and son still live here, and Berkeley is the locus of the Richard Diebenkorn Foundation.\nAs Matisse/Diebenkorn reveals, Diebenkorn's obsession with Matisse persisted and evolved in tandem with each phase of his career. The exhibition pursues that central thread in Diebenkorn's artistic trajectory. It's also a curatorial tour de force. Conceived and co-organized by Janet Bishop, Curator of Painting and Sculpture at SFMOMA, and Katy Rothkopf, Senior Curator at the Baltimore Museum of Art, it assembles a breathtaking array of paintings and drawings by these artists -- 40 by Matisse, 60 by Diebenkorn -- from collections all over the world, that illuminates and enriches our understanding of, and appreciation for, them both.\nLeft: Henri Matisse, The Blue Window, 1913; oil on canvas; the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Fund; (c) Succession H.

Right: Richard Diebenkorn, Woman on a Porch, 1958; oil on canvas; New Orleans Museum of Art, museum purchase through the National Endowment for the Arts Matching Grant; (c)the Richard Diebenkorn FoundationDiebenkorn first saw Matisse's works in person as a Stanford undergrad in 1943, when his art professor took him to the Palo Alto home of Sarah Stein. Sarah, wife of Michael Stein -- who was brother to Gertrude and Leo Stein -- had collected Matisse's work when she lived in Paris. She owned more than 100 paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures, and ceramics by Matisse, including his portraits of her -- notably, the arresting, Fauvist Woman with a Hat (1905) -- and she commissioned him to make portraits of both her and Michael in California. (Matisse visited the Bay Area in 1930.) These pieces -- some of the major ones are now in SFMOMA's collection -- made an indelible impression on the young Diebenkorn. Like a newly hatched duckling, he seems to have imprinted on the first artistic kindred spirit he encountered. Matisse became his lifelong idol and exemplar.\nSoon after that visit, as a newly married Marine stationed near Washington D.C. during World War II, Diebenkorn made frequent pilgrimages to see the Matisses in the Phillips Collection in D.C., and travelled to New York's Museum of Modern Art, the Barnes Foundation and the Philadelphia Museum of Art to absorb their Matisse collections and exhibitions. According to art critic Phylis Tuchman, \"At each institution, he continued to be enthralled by Matisse's color combinations, sinuous lines, and flair for composition -- and he was intrigued, too, by the former Fauve's pentimenti, decorative flourishes, and downright awkwardness.\"\nThe 1952 Matisse retrospective in Los Angeles, which Diebenkorn saw while visiting his LA in-laws, was an epiphany for him. \"It absolutely turned my head around,\" he said. In 1963, he accepted an arduous cultural exchange trip to Russia specifically to see the Matisses in the Pushkin Museum in Moscow and the Hermitage in Leningrad; while waiting for his visa in Paris, he used his time to view Matisses in the art museums there. He was deeply impressed by the internationally traveling Matisse retrospective when it came to UCLA's Art Galleries in 1966.\nConstructed almost like a legal brief, Matisse/Diebenkorn applies persuasive visual and biographical evidence to argue the case for Matisse's artistic inspiration in every facet of technique, composition, medium and subject matter, and through every stylistic stage, of Diebenkorn's practice. Their relationship is illustrated via brilliant pairings of similar -- often uncannily similar -- paintings and drawings by the two artists, following the chronology of Diebenkorn's oeuvre (not Matisse's). The side-by-side juxtapositions are startling in their resemblance to each other, even when one is figurative and the other abstract.\nHenri Matisse, Studio, Quai Saint-Michel, 1916; oil on canvas; The Phillips Collection, Washington,D.C.; (c) Succession H. Matisse / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New YorkAs the over-used and and variously attributed aphorism goes, \"Good artists borrow; great artists steal.\" Diebenkorn's works are not slavish copies, nor are they simple homages to the elder artist. Yet Diebenkorn clearly channeled and metabolized into his own compositions Matisse's architectonic structures, geometries and flattened perspective, his interest in depicting homely interiors opening onto the outdoors, his preoccupation with the female figure, his experiments with landscapes and still lifes, his unorthodox use of color, his love of decorative motifs, his assertive clash of patterns and interlocking shapes, and his practice of leaving traces that deliberately reveal the trial-and-error process involved in arriving at the picture's final form.\nDon't miss... SFMOMA's  'Matisse / Diebenkorn' exhibition is augmented by vitrine displays of annotated books on Matisse in Diebenkorn's personal collection. It is accompanied by an optional audio guide with commentary by various people, including from Diebenkorn's daughter Gretchen Diebenkorn Grant. A beautifully produced, profusely illustrated catalogue with informative and readable essays by the curators and other experts is available for sale in SFMOMA's bookstore.Like Matisse, Diebenkorn was very much his own artist with his own vision, of his own time and place. Where Matisse's studio windows opened to the sun-drenched plage at Nice, the door of a Diebenkorn room opens out to a Berkeley gas station. Matisse's sensuous, sinuous portraits of his female models convey tenderness and intimacy. Diebenkorn's stiff depictions of female models (including his wife) often lack facial features and usually show them looking away from the viewer, rapt in their own inwardness. Matisse's interiors burst with color, light, pattern and joie de vivre. Diebenkorn's interiors are spare, dark and relatively bleak; they seem empty, even when cluttered with the artist's work. The scattered flower petals in a small Matisse still life, reminiscent of both Chardin and Cezanne, delicately convey the entire tradition of the European memento mori. Diebenkorn's wonderful still life of an overflowing ashtray may also metaphorically foreshadow death, but it alludes more directly to the early 20th-century American Ashcan (or Ashtray?) School of painting.\nLike the world of Edward Hopper, whom Diebenkorn also admired, the latter's world seems one of isolation, distance and detachment. His work describes an estranged state of being that would have been quite foreign to Matisse.\nBy the time you reach the final gallery in this show, you begin to wonder what kind of artist Diebenkorn might have been without Matisse's influence. And if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, you also wonder if Matisse would have been flattered by Diebenkorn's adulation. Those questions aren't answerable, but it's fun to speculate.\nDiebenkorn's bromance with Matisse was, of necessity, unrequited. As everybody knows, the heartache of unrequited love may inspire great poetry. Hence this show.\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "A fine bromance: 'Matisse / Diebenkorn' at SFMOMA", "Tags": "[]", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts']", "Natural Language Location": "SFMOMA", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.785735", "Zip Code": "94103", "ID": "254143", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.401072", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/04/12/fine-bromance-matisse-diebenkorn-sfmoma/", "Author": "Marcia Tanner", "Date": "2017-04-12T11:16:59-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Father and son experience the uncanny in Life After LifeThis is the second and final week of San Francisco International Film Festival programming at Pacific Film Archive (check out the full schedule). Last week, I highlighted some movies worth seeing. Below, some of what's on during the week ahead:\nHanyi Zhang's Life After Life (Zhi Fan Ye Mao, screening at 4 p.m. on Friday, April 14) is a low-key ghost story with a decidedly undemonstrative ghost. Set in a Chinese village on the edge of a rapidly expanding city, the story revolves around a teenage boy's possession by the spirit of his late mother, who's intent on saving a sacred tree from the bulldozers.\nThis sounds a lot spookier than it actually is: son/spirit host Leilei (Zhang Li) neither spits pea soup nor levitates, merely announcing to widower Mingchun (Zhang Mingjun) in his normal voice that he's now his deceased wife Xiuying. This is presented in such a matter-of-fact manner that a badly timed sneeze or cough could easily result in your missing this critical plot development.\nFather and son/deceased wife don't seem particularly fond of each other but dutifully take on their arboreal task. At eighty minutes, Life After Life is just long enough, it's lingering static and tracking shots of desolate woods and industrial wasteland suggesting that rural Chinese - and their traditions and superstitions - are rapidly being overrun by forces beyond their control.\n\nFormer OPD Chief Sean Whent as seen in The ForceSaturday, April 15, is a particularly notable day, with two of the Festival's centerpieces on tap. First up is The Force (screening at 4 p.m.), a documentary of significant local interest that will garner a wider release later this year. Directed by local Peter Nicks (The Waiting Room), the film is a bit schizophrenic: the first half details the Oakland Police Department's efforts to end its 12-years-long-and-counting stretch of federal oversight, while the second focuses on the ground lost in the wake of 2016's Celeste Guap scandal. One suspects Nicks began the film thinking it would be a tale of redemption; instead, it ends up being a tale of deep-rooted systemic rot and corruption.\nUnusual happenings are the order of the day in The OrnithologistIf you can only see one film this week, let it be The Ornithologist (O Ornitologo, screening Saturday April 15 at 8:30 p.m.). The story of a birder (Paul Hamy) lost in the Portuguese wilderness (no, I didn't know there was such a thing, either), the film takes viewers on an increasingly bizarre and uneasy journey in which our hero meets two Chinese girls on pilgrimage, a young goatherd, some strangely attired locals, and three bare-breasted amazons on horseback.\nWritten and directed by Joao Pedro Rodrigues, The Ornithologist offers a Bunuelian take on themes first explored in Robin Hardy's The Wicker Man (1973). In addition to a striking visual reference to Il Sodoma's 'Martyrdom of St. Sebastian', it also features one of the eeriest scores of recent vintage, a cacophony of tortured violin strings courtesy composer Severine Ballon. I loved the music (and the movie), but you might want to bring earplugs.\nA scene from the Canadian drama SearchersThe curtain comes down on Sunday April 16, with Searchers (Maliglutit, screening at 1:30 p.m.), among the Festival's final offerings. Loosely based on John Ford's western classic The Searchers (1956), and set among the indigenous people of Nunavut, Canada, the film is a (literally) chilling tale of far north revenge.

Photo: Hershey Felder PresentsHershey Felder as Irving Berlin is one in a series of one-man musical biographies written and performed by Hershey Felder. Berkeley Rep theater-goers and critics, myself included, have already sung the praises of Felder, the gifted concert pianist, composer and actor, who wrote and performed the first-rate one-man show, George Gershwin Alone (2013), the exciting, Maestro, about Leonard Bernstein (2014) and Monsieur Chopin (2014). Now he's back with a similarly structured biographical and musical performance about the great American composer and lyricist, Irving Berlin (1888-1989).\nAlthough the Felder shtick may be too much of a good thing at this point, Hershey Felder as Irving Berlin is definitely entertaining.\nIt's hard to complain about learning about Berlin's fascinating life, considering that this Jewish immigrant travelled from Russia to the US at five years of age. And what's harder, he travelled from New York's tenement-ridden Lower East Side to its swank Beekman Place, despite leaving school at age eight. Berlin's happy and lengthy marriage to Ellin Mackay, a Catholic socialite, is another fascinating aspect of the songwriter's long, largely fortunate life.\nYet these facts are readily obtainable from the detailed Wikipedia article about Berlin. But I did learn one tidbit from Wikipedia. The article mentioned that Berlin had the nervous habit of continually pressing his hair down in back. I was relieved to read this, because I thought that Felder was pressing a toupee in place, when he was merely mimicking a habit of Berlin's. Felder did explain Berlin's departure from his early upbeat tunes by linking two tragic losses in the songwriter's life to his move to well-constructed songs with slower tempos and more somber lyrics. And we learned the story behind the best-selling song of all time, White Christmas (1942).\n\nIt's always a treat to hear Berlin's glorious music and lyrics. Among others, Felder sings, and plays, Berlin's first mega-hit, Alexander's Ragtime Band (1911), written when Berlin was 23 years old; his poignant, What'll I Do (1924); the cheery Blue Skies (1926) written to celebrate the birth of Berlin's first baby daughter; the patriotic God Bless America (1938), the royalties of which Berlin donated to the Girl and Boy Scouts; White Christmas; and tunes from some of Berlin's Hollywood movie musicals, Puttin' On the Ritz (1930) and This Is the Army (1943), as well as the Broadway musicals, Annie Get Your Gun (1946) and Call Me Madam (1953). A few times, Felder invites the audience to sing along. It is hard not to join in.\nFelder is a talented concert pianist and actor, yet his musical performance seemed overly florid and elaborate (some might say, schmaltzy), especially considering that Berlin was by no means an accomplished concert pianist. And the biographical presentation was a bit schmaltzy as well, designed to capitalize on the tear-jerking aspects of Berlin's life. Though this did add to the theatricality of the evening, it felt a bit forced.\nHershey Felder as Irving Berlin, a 105 minute, intermission-less glimpse into the life and songs of one of America's most cherished musical talents, is a charming production, with high production values and a self-assured, talented host.\nHershey Felder as Irving Berlin is playing at Berkeley Rep through April 30.

Musica Pacifica is one of the leading baroque music ensembles in the US, winning praise for its \"dazzling virtuosity\" and \"warm expressiveness.\" The group consists of recorder player Judith Linsenberg (\"the Jascha Heifetz of the recorder\"), violinist Elizabeth Blumenstock, viola da gamba player Farley Pearce, and harpsichordist Charles Sherman. In addition to Telemann, Musica Pacifica will be playing works by some of his Dresden court colleagues, including Veracini, Pisendel, and WF Bach.

Backing St. Mary are Myrna Cooper on rubboard and vocals, guitarist Ian Lamson, bassist Dana Mandell, and drummer Timothy Orr. Saturday, April 8, dance lesson at 8 p.m., show at 9 p.m., Ashkenaz, 1317 San Pablo Ave.\nFRONT COUNTRY Front Country celebrate the release of their second album, Other Love Songs, at the Freight on Sunday. Here's their pitch: \"An acoustic band born in the land of tech innovation, Front Country was never going to be accepted as an authentic American roots band out of the gate. Cutting their teeth in progressive bluegrass jams in San Francisco's Mission District and rehearsing in the East Bay, they learned to play roots music their own way, with the tools they had on hand. A mandolinist with a degree in composition and classical guitar. A guitarist trained in rock and world music. A bassist equally versed in jazz and bluegrass. A violinist with technique that could seamlessly hop between honky tonk and electropop. A female lead singer with grit and soul that was also a multi-instrumentalist and songwriter. In a wood-paneled country dive bar in the shadow of the San Francisco skyline, Front Country forged a sound hell bent on merging the musical past with the future.\" Sound like your kind of evening?

Photo: Emilie RagusoBerkeley zoning board members asked developer Realtex to rethink its plans for an 8-story, 39-unit building on Telegraph Avenue, which is slated to replace quirky indoor mall \"The Village.\" The 86-foot-tall building would include 3,200 square feet of ground-floor commercial, and one live-work unit on Blake Street around the corner.\nThe new project plans to use \"The Village\" as its name in homage to the eccentric shopping area at 2556 Telegraph that would be demolished if plans proceed. Thursday night, the city's Zoning Adjustments Board got its first look at project plans, though designs have been circulating in the community since the project was submitted in 2015.\nCommunity members and commissioners alike were largely unified in their feedback, saying the building is too tall and needs to fit in better with the surrounding neighborhood. Commissioners asked the developer to consider adding a loading zone, and perhaps some parking, to the project plans. They also asked for shadow studies, and a reconsideration of the unit mix.\nCurrently, 24 of the project's units are proposed to include four bedrooms, which is a rare offering in Berkeley. Commissioners and community members said they believed many of those units would go to students. Some said they have no doubt the project will be a \"mini-dorm\" due to its proximity to UC Berkeley and its lack of proposed parking.\n\nDeveloper Realtex said it hasn't decided exactly who its tenants will be, but is aiming for a combination of young professionals, students and families.\nChilton Way. Image: Google MapsThe project is proposing three affordable units on site, and a payment of $714,000 into the city's Housing Trust Fund, which Berkeley uses to build affordable housing elsewhere. Commissioners said they'd like to see more affordable housing on site, and fewer four-bedroom units. Commissioners noted that, though the unit count is low, the bedroom count is quite high, meaning neighborhood impacts would need to be carefully considered.\nCommissioner Shoshana O'Keefe said she'd like to see plans for a 6-story building on the Telegraph side, stepping down to 3 stories on the west side of the property, so it might fit in better with the nearby neighborhood. Other commissioners said they were in support of that idea, too.\nA number of residents of Chilton Way, a one-block street that runs north-south just half a block west of Telegraph, said they are very concerned about what an 8-story building would do to their neighborhood. They described their block as a unique microcosm of Berkeley, with a diverse mix of all sorts of tenants, and said they hoped the city would help protect their neighborhood's character. Many said a tall building focused on one type of tenant -- students -- would not be a good fit.\n\"We don't want to see Berkeley divided demographically, and we don't want to see our neighborhood turned into a corporatized and 'dormatized' district,\" said Lawrence Rinder, who lives on Chilton Way. He said the developer had also misrepresented the project's scale in its drawings, making it look smaller than it actually would be.\nOther neighbors said Realtex was \"being deceptive about their intentions\" about who would live in the building. A man who identified himself as \"Tom,\" a 30-year resident of Chilton Way, described the design as \"hideous\" and asked the zoning board to pay close attention as the process proceeds: \"There's just too many elements of this that are very fishy.\"\nSome neighbors said they were also concerned about a rooftop garden and the potential for loud parties every weekend.\nNeighbors and commissioners weren't the only ones to raise questions. The project planner told the zoning board he wasn't sure how the applicant had come up with its calculation to reach 8 stories, and there was ample indication Thursday night that the board would not legally be required to approve it at that height. When the project was first submitted in 2015, it came in at 7 stories, which many also said was too tall.\nSome commissioners questioned the lack of parking and were told by staff that, though the district does not require parking, the board does have the discretion to ask for it as part of the approval process.\nSome people said they would be sad to see the closure of The Village indoor mall -- home of restaurants like Finfine, Norikonoko and Fondue Fred -- and said they hope the new retail space would be neighborhood-serving and welcoming to the community. In June of last year, the city's landmarks commission denied landmark status to the mall, but many have said they believe it's a special place that will be missed. Commissioner Charles Kahn said he'd like the developer to consider breaking up the new commercial space so smaller, family-owned businesses could \"make a go of it.\"\nSee complete project documents on the city websiteCommissioner Denise Pinkston said she saw the proposal as an example of \"millennial dorms\" or \"shared living spaces\" where people essentially rent by the bedroom and pay $1,000-$1,500 a month for the area they're getting. She said she'd seen dozens of similar designs, regionally, in the past few years as people try to come up with creative solutions to the Bay Area's high housing costs.\n\"There are Cal students who are homeless who are sleeping in the buildings on campus,\" she said, adding that not every project needs to include family housing or feature extensive parking. That's especially true, she said, for housing near UC Berkeley, which has historically not provided sufficient housing for students.\n\"I think this is that kind of cutting-edge new building,\" Pinkston said. \"It isn't going to look like anything we've seen before.\"\nShe and others said they wanted a lot more information about how the affordable units would be managed, given the potential complexities of having multiple tenants who were essentially independent, while needing to comply with affordability rules.\nOther commissioners said the city does need to prioritize family housing. Commissioner Leah Simon-Weisberg said Berkeley should not be \"forcing adults to live\" in such close proximity to each other, and that it should not be the case that people making $100,000 a year \"can only afford to live in 5-bedroom apartments with five other adults or 10 other adults.\"\nSimon-Weisberg said the city has already lost too many teachers and families \"because we're building student housing that the students can't even afford.\"\n\"This cannot be the new norm,\" she added.\nThe project is set to come before the city's Design Review Committee in April, and could come back to the zoning board in several months though no date has been set.\nCoda: The meeting began, during public comment, with a poem by Paul Matzner called, \"We Berkeleyans.\" It appears below.\n\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "8-story building proposed on Telegraph gets tepid response", "Tags": "['2556 Telegraph', 'Berkeley real estate', 'Blake Street', 'Charles Kahn', 'Cody Fornari', 'Denise Pinkston', 'Finfine', 'Fondue Fred', 'Housing in Berkeley', 'Koryo', 'Leah Simon-Weisberg', 'Norikonoko', 'Realtex', u'Shoshana O\\u2019Keefe', 'Southside Berkeley', 'Student housing', 'Telegraph Avenue', 'The Village']", "Sections": "['Business', 'Business', 'Real Estate', 'UC Berkeley']", "Natural Language Location": "2566 Telegraph Ave. ", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8636841", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "252590", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2611743", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/24/berkeley-zoning-board-asks-smaller-building-realtex-preview/", "Author": "Emilie Raguso", "Date": "2017-03-24T16:00:35-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Customers at the original location of Barclay's in Rockridge.

Photo: Marcell TurnerAlex Popov and Chris Hoff are all smiles. Their long-awaited music venue and beer garden, Cornerstone, has finally, finally opened.\nThe pair, along with Popov's wife Stephanie Dodson and Hoff's brother Greg, started work on the Shattuck Avenue space, which used to house the pool hall bar Thalassa, in January 2015. But between permitting and construction delays, along with meticulous planning on the part of Popov and Hoff, it has taken far longer than expected to get the building's doors open.\nAll of those headaches seem to be fully behind the pair -- their excitement about the entire space, from beer bar to venue mezzanine, is infectious. This, despite the fact that Cornerstone is still in basically a soft opening mode offering only bar service until later this week. The kitchen will open first, along with a smaller stage inside the restaurant space.\nThe larger venue space will not hold music shows until next month. For now, the venue area is playing host to ping pong tables, corn hole boards and a giant collection of Jenga blocks. Popov said Cornerstone has already been a draw for such serious ping pong players that they bring in their own paddles.\n\nMuch of Cornerstone's 50-foot main bar is dedicated to a sprawling 42-tap beer list that is divided up into easy-to-use categories: hoppy, dark, light, tart, cider and \"specialty\" finds. There is also a short bottle list.\nThe aim, both Popov and Hoff said, is to keep the beer program accessible.\n\"We want people who don't know much [about beer] to be able to come here and ask questions and educate themselves if they want,\" said Popov. In addition to bringing in certified cicerones (sommeliers for beer) to work at the restaurant, Popov has taught his bartenders about tasting beers and identifying off-tastes, so they're as knowledgable as possible for his guests. He's also planning to stock beer magazines around the bar for perusing. Many beers, much of them lower in ABV, or alcohol, are available by the pitcher.\nSome of the beer options at Cornerstone. Photo: Cornerstone/FacebookCornerstone does have a full liquor license and some of the drink offerings Popov is most excited about are high-end boilermakers featuring whiskey and beer pairings. There is also a craft cocktail list.\nPopov added that he's been grateful for the help he's gotten from Michael Richard, who has worked at Ol Beercafe in Walnut Creek and currently runs a company, Liquid Curations, that helps with beer list curation. In addition to Cornerstone, Richard has developed the beer lists at Portal, Philomena Pizza and Rosamunde.\nCornerstone is pouring everything from Fieldwork IPAs and Faction pale ale to Council Beatitude tart saison and Harmonic Brewing's English ale made with Marasca cherries. It even offers Abita root beer on tap which is, according to Hoff, the \"best root beer I've ever had. I even put down my beer to drink it.\"\nOne of Popov's \"beer guys\" even drove down to San Diego recently to pick up several kegs of one-offs and special beers from places like Abnormal Beer Company, which are usually harder to find in the East Bay.\nHis experience bringing in craft beer at his Telegraph Avenue bar, Pappy's Grill, was also instructional. Before that, Popov didn't know that beer bars often have to be responsible for cleaning out their own lines that bring the beer from the keg to the tap, as smaller breweries don't have the capacity to do so when they deliver their beers. (Larger companies, like Budweiser, will often clean the lines when they deliver beers, according to Popov.)\n\"I learned a lot [doing this] at Pappy's,\" Popov said. \"I'm happy to work with craft beer folks that know more because, unless you have that trained palate, it's hard to do craft beer correctly. Beer is food, so it needs to taste good.\"\nSpeaking of food, Cornerstone's menu will be fairly simple. Popov and Hoff described it as \"rustic comfort food that tastes good with beer.\" Think -- pot pie, ribs, meatloaf and vegetarian lasagna. It will also serve macaroni and cheese balls, which will be baked in a Turbo Chef oven instead of being fried, Paula Deen style.\nThe back patio area at Cornerstone contains two large fire pits and space for breweries to hold tap takeover events. Photo: Marcell TurnerFood will be available in the large dining area that includes several long, tall tables that can accommodate large parties, or on the back patio/beer garden area complete with two massive fire pits. There is also a special eight-tap bar system set up on the patio that Popov said will be perfect for tap takeovers. Breweries can basically plug-and-play at this bar without having to disrupt the main bar set-up. There's also plenty of space to schmooze and sell swag, said Popov.\nOf course, all of this is just half of the Cornerstone offerings. The other side of the space is the formal venue area, which is still in progress. Just last week, Popov and Hoff were in the space helping the sound system get set up, and work on the eight-tap venue bar is just finishing up. Once work is complete, Popov said it will host a wide range of acts, everything from reggae musicians to indie rock bands to hip hop artists. (Smaller acts can book the cafe stage in the restaurant.)\nThe venue space at Cornerstone functions as a ping pong and corn hole arena when there aren't performers on stage. Photo: Marcell TurnerThe venue space will fit around 500 people, and Popov and Hoff have designed it with attention to every detail. It has a separate entrance from the restaurant, on Durant Avenue, and the ticket office, coat check, and merchandising space are all right next to this entrance. Acts have their own dedicated entrance as well, with easy access to a green room, the merchandising space, and, of course, the stage. A VIP mezzanine, which will also likely have its own bar, circles the perimeter of the audience space. Two smaller, family and friends areas are directly above the 24-by-16-foot stage.\nCornerstone\n2367 Shattuck Ave. (at Durant), BerkeleyFacebookPopov said they are already planning to host several non-music events, such as Pints for Paws, in the venue space. He said they're also talking about hosting a go-cart race with New Belgium brewing, a VR drone race and events for the Bay Area Book Festival this spring.\nKey to the whole design, which was masterminded by Berkeley's Studio KDA, is the fact that the venue and the restaurant can operate as two separate businesses, with closed heavy doors separating them, or as one single, 13,000-square foot space.\nIn a way, Cornerstone is a combination of many different beer bars, restaurants, and venues. \"We went to lots of venues and bars and combined them all into the best place possible,\" said Hoff.\n\"We're offering both craft beer and craft music,\" said Popov. \"It's very unique.\"\n", "Coder Initials": "CS", "Title": "Now open: Cornerstone, a destination for 'craft beer and craft music'", "Tags": "['Berkeley dining', 'Berkeley drinking', 'Cornerstone']", "Sections": "['Business', 'Business', 'Drink', 'Nosh']", "Natural Language Location": "Cornerstone", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8663488", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "251872", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2693839", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/20/now-open-cornerstone-destination-craft-beer-craft-music/", "Author": "Kate Williams", "Date": "2017-03-20T13:48:51-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Amy Murry, owner of Venus in downtown Berkeley, has sold the restaurant to the owners of Tigerlily.

Photo: Sam Harnett/KQEDBy Sam Harnett/KQED\nThe vast assortment of reclaimed junk at Urban Ore draws all kinds of people, like Chicken John.\nOne recent day, Chicken John was picking up some rusty, squeaky ironing boards. John is from \"the San Francisco Institute of Possibility.\" He runs this \"rotten boat-building contest\" in the summer, where kids and adults create vessels out of trash. \"Whoever builds the worst boat wins,\" John said.\nUrban Ore operates out of a cavernous 3-acre warehouse at 900 Murray St., near Ashby Avenue and Seventh Street. It's filled with all sorts of thrown-out stuff for sale: appliances, furniture, scrap metal, artwork, antiques, a giant papier-mache dragon head. The collection of old doors alone is impressive. The place has somewhere between 4,000 and 6,000.\n\nUrban Ore is filled to the brim with all sorts of reclaimed trash. Photo: Sam Harnett/KQEDEnd of an era\nThe owners of Urban Ore estimate that the business keeps some 7,000 or 8,000 tons of trash per year out of landfills. To give you some perspective, that is about half the amount of what the entire city of Berkeley recycles in a year. It's difficult to verify how much Urban Ore actually diverts from the landfill, but even if it's only a fraction of what the owners claim, it would make the business a major cog in Berkeley's thriving recycling ecosystem. And it could disappear. That's because the owners of the 36-year-old business, Dan Knapp and Mary Lou Van Deventer, are ready to retire.\nUrban Ore is one of the many businesses in the Bay Area run by baby boomers on the edge of retirement. New analysis of census data by the nonprofit Project Equity finds that in the Bay Area, boomers hold nearly half of all privately owned businesses with employees. As they retire, they're selling off their companies or just closing shop.\nThe Iron Law\nDecades ago, Knapp quit his job as a sociology professor and started riding his bike to the dump, salvaging what he could. Over the years, he and Van Deventer built the business by sorting and selling garbage -- squeezing juice from the trash, as they say around here.\nKnapp devised a meticulous system for splitting it all into categories. By separating reusable items, from metal and chemicals, there is less cross-contamination. The trash can be resold, the scrap metal recycled and the chemicals disposed of safely. \"I call it the iron law of recycling,\" Knapp said. \"The more categories the more money.\"\nThis is the key to the business: Dan Knapp's 12-category system for sorting and processing trash. Photo: Sam Harnett/KQEDIn 2000, the couple bought Urban Ore's spacious warehouse. Today it's a real-estate gold mine.\nKnapp said, \"We bought the place at $3 million and it's worth three times that now.\"\n\"Both our lawyer and our banker have advised us to sell the property and take the money.\" Van Deventer added, \"but we said we spent our lives building the business.\"\nTransition of power\nKnapp andVan Deventer are now in their 70s, and they want the business to be around long after they're gone. But Knapp's kids don't want the Ore, and they said an outsider wouldn't know how to run it.\n\"I call it the iron law of recycling. The more categories the more money.\" Dan Knapp, Co-owner, Urban Ore\"The nature of the business is in the activity of it,\" Van Deventer said. \"It's in the busyness.\"\nIt's in the 38 busy employees who know how the Ore works -- what makes the business tick. If only the couple could somehow transfer the company to them.\nAlison Lingane is co-founder of Project Equity, a three-year-old nonprofit that aims to help companies move to employee ownership.\n\"Most people aren't aware that employee ownership is an option,\" Lingane said. \"That they have a potential buyer right there under their nose.\"\nLingane thinks employee ownership could be a great way to keep baby boomer businesses and the income they generate local. Project Equity crunched census numbers and found that over 60,000 businesses in the Bay Area are owned by aging boomers. The nonprofit is working with Urban Ore, which Lingane hopes can be a model for other entrepreneurs getting ready to retire.\n\"Are we going to sit back and let these businesses either quietly go away or be consolidated -- bought by out-of-area buyers, so wealth becomes concentrated? Or are we going to take this opportunity to keep at least a chunk of them locally owned and deepen their roots by transitioning them to employee ownership?\" Lingane asked.\nShe said American business owners are unfamiliar with how to transfer power to their workers. With Lingane's guidance, employees are preparing to use Urban Ore's equity to take out a loan and buy the company. It would become a worker-owned co-op like Rainbow Grocery or Arizmendi Bakery. There would still be a similar management structure, but workers would share in both the profits and the decision-making.\nShoulders of giants\nMax Wechsler, Urban Ore's assistant manager, is excited to keep the original owners' vision going. \"At night I read stuff that they've written,\" Wechsler said. \"They're such valuable resources. So I am standing on the shoulders of giants here.\"\nChristopher Sprague, receiving manager at Urban Ore, says it would be great for employees to have greater ownership of the business.

It has kept the layout of the Andronico's stores intact, as well as much of the original stores' \"unique offerings,\" said Safeway in the statement.\n\"These stores will resonate well with the needs and wants of the community,\" said Tom Schwilke, the president of Safeway Northern California, in the statement. \"Customers will find tons of local, fresh and organic options with everyday low prices.\"\nThe produce and bulk sections in the new Safeway Community Markets look much the same as they did as Andronico's.

In addition, the stores offer full-service catering with fresh and seasonal menus made by our trained chefs in our kitchens.\"\nIn November, Andronico's also told Berkeleyside that the proximity between the stores would not be a problem: \"Most importantly, the new Safeway Community Markets will still have the same team of employees that staff the Andronico's Community Markets store today.

Still, after discussing this with the staff we have decided that we will close the store for the day. We do understand that not everyone can join the strike, but we urge you to spend some time on February 17 thinking about the state of the country, and that you consider resisting this regime in your own way.\"  Berkeley's Eastwind Books is also closing Friday, \"in solidarity with Moe's and other businesses,\" it told Berkeleyside.\nThursday afternoon the Berkeley Food Institute issued a statement declaring its solidarity for the #daywithoutimmigrants work boycott, writing: \"The strike's intention is to send a clear message about the impact immigrants have on our country every single day.

Photo: Emilie RagusoBerkeley City Council Tuesday night upheld the appeal against the Zoning Adjustments Board's March 2016 decision to approve a three-unit housing project at 1310 Haskell St. The decision seems certain to provoke a civil suit against the city.\nNormally, a small housing project does not take a year to wend its way from ZAB to the council. This one involves replacing a single-family home with three new detached two-story homes. But the Haskell Street project was in fact rejected by the council in July 2016. That decision triggered a civil suit - Bay Area Renter's Federation et. al. v. City of Berkeley - based on the state's Housing Accountability Act (HAA). Last October, the city settled the suit by agreeing to rescind its July decision, hold a new public hearing, and to comply with the HAA in its decision at the rehearing.\nCity staff had recommended the council approve the use permit. In a presentation to the council, staff from the planning department said that the lot was zoned for up to four three-story units. The proposed project was to build three two-story units.\nRendering of the proposed three housing unitsAccording to the HAA, if a housing development meets a city's zoning and planning guidelines, it can only be denied if it has a \"specific adverse impact on public health or safety.\" According to the city staff, there were no issues that would disqualify the project.\n\nA long line of Haskell Street neighbors disagreed, citing traffic, parking and other issues.\nThe council majority sided with the vocal neighbors, but did not base their decision on an adverse impact. Mayor Jesse Arreguin said that while the use permit would be required by the HAA, the necessary demolition permit for the existing single-family house on the site was not covered. He said if the project kept the existing house and proposed another three units on the site, eliminating the need for a demolition permit, it would not raise any issues.\n\"Council came to the conclusion because we are granting additional discretionary permits, we determined that we are not obligated to have to follow the act with respect to the project,\" Arreguin said to Berkeleyside. \"Code doesn't require a demolition permit. That's an additional permit that the applicant is requesting.\"\nCity attorney Zach Cowan disagreed when questioned at the council meeting.\n\"My reading is that [the HAA] would encompass whatever discretionary permits are necessary,\" Cowan said. \"I think that would encompass the demolition.\"\nBlueprint showing the proposed new housing at 1310 Haskell St. looking south towards the site. Source: City staff reportBoth Arreguin and Cowan agreed that there is relatively little case law on the issue.\nArreguin's motion to deny the use permit passed 5-2, with only council members Lori Droste and Susan Wengraf opposing the motion. Council member Sophie Hahn recused herself from the matter since she had been on the ZAB when the original decision was made. A prior motion to deny the appeal failed 4-3, with Droste and Wengraf joined by Councilman Kriss Worthington (Worthington voted yes both to approve and oppose the project in the two separate motions).\nBrian Hanlon, co-executive director, California Renters Legal Advocacy and Education Fund (CaRLA), which funded and was party to the civil suit last year, told Berkeleyside that a new suit was certain.\n\"As far as I'm concerned, the City Council violated the stipulated order that they signed,\" Hanlon said to Berkeleyside. \"They did not make specific adverse findings that this project would have a negative impact on health and safety. It was mostly rather vague. We're now going to have to go back to the court to enforce it. We're going to ask the court to take remedial action.\"\nHanlon said CaRLA would seek an expedited decision from the courts, but timing of the suit was not yet certain.\nOthers involved in the Bay Area Renter's Federation (BARF) were equally certain of legal action.\n\n\n.@JesseArreguin We will sue you again, and we will win.

Have fun getting sued @JesseArreguin @LindaMaio @benny4berkeley!\n-- SFBA Metro Observer (@MetroObserver) March 1, 2017\n\nAt the heart of the dispute between the council majority and CaRLA, BARF and other advocates is the extent of city discretion on approving or denying housing projects.\n\"It's important that we understand what our rights are as a city under the Housing Accountability Act and that we exercise our discretion to shape the built environment of our city,\" Arreguin said. \"SF BARF has a political agenda to tie the hands of cities. I think it would be more appropriate if they focused on Danville and Moraga and other cities that have not met their fair share rather than going after Berkeley and trying to strip the city of its land-use authority. I think we made the right decision.\"\nHanlon disagrees with Arreguin's perspective.\n\"The Housing Accountability Act used to be known as the anti-NIMBY law,\" Hanlon said. \"The point of the act is the legislature way back in 1982 saw that localities were denying housing for any number of reasons. The legislature said we're not going to take away your discretion. The act preserves local land use and local zoning. All it says is localities have to follow their own laws.\"\nHanlon said Arreguin's statements at the council meeting amounted to \"faux populist fear mongering.\"\n\"It shows you how absurd the situation has become in places like Berkeley,\" he said. \"You have massive organizing at the local level to obstruct three homes.

Photo: Andy KatzState Senator Nancy Skinner has introduced a bill that aims to limit the closure of full-service hospitals in the East Bay. The move was prompted by the closure in 2015 of Doctors Medical hospital in San Pablo, and the proposed closure of Alta Bates hospital in Berkeley.\nAt a press conference Monday, Senator Skinner was joined by Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin, along with Assembly Member Tony Thurmond, Alameda County Supervisor Wilma Chan, medical practitioners, first-responders and patients, to explain the thinking behind the legislation, SB 687 (Skinner).\nWith the closure of Doctors Medical, residents in West Contra Costa are reliant on 50-bed hospital Richmond Kaiser and Alta Bates with its 300 beds, Skinner said. Sutter Health has said it needs to close Alta Bates before 2030 because of state seismic laws. (It proposes moving inpatient services to Oakland, leaving Berkeley services focused on outpatient care.) Such a closure, Skinner said, would leave all residents in the I-80 corridor that stretches from Rodeo in the north to Berkeley in the south dependent on Oakland hospitals for emergency care -- facing the prospect of ambulances having to navigate I-80, including during rush hour, to get patients to the ER.\nLocal officials have minimal power to halt hospital closures. Currently, the law only requires that a hospital planning to close its emergency department provide 90 days' notice to the state. SB 687 would require non-profit hospitals in California to obtain approval from the state Attorney General before closing emergency departments, and to hold at least one public hearing about the planned closure. If passed, the bill would require the Attorney General consider the impacts a closure would have on the availability and accessibility of healthcare services.\n\n\"When hospitals and emergency rooms close, patients pay the price with longer wait times and decreased health outcomes,\" said Senator Skinner, stressing the need to prevent \"hospital deserts.\" \"My legislation will create a layer of protection for the health of our communities.\"\nThurmond said that after the closure of Doctors Medical, the number of visits to Kaiser Richmond tripled. \"It has been proved that mortality rates go up with closures,\" he said.\nStudies evaluating the impacts of hospital closures show that loss of hospital emergency departments increases the risk of death by 15% for patients in the affected area who have a stroke or heart attack.\nThis point was brought home Monday by former Doctors Medical physician Dr. Desmond Carson who said he had seen patients die because of the closure of the hospital's ER. \"Time is life,\" he said. \"Every minute after a stroke, 4 million braincells die.\"\nSpeaking of Sutter's wish to close Alta Bates, Thurmond said: \"Sutter can relocate within the I-80 corridor - they can reinvest and double down in our community.\"\nMayor Arreguin has made saving Alta Bates hospital one of the central planks of his administration, along with addressing Berkeley's homelessness crisis.\nThe biggest challenge, he said, is city government having no say in decisions made by hospital owners, \"despite the fact they are nonprofits and we give them enormous tax breaks.\"\nSpeaking to Berkeleyside, Arreguin said if one of the issues with Alta Bates was money, then he would want to talk with Sutter Health. The mayor said he also sees potential for expansion at Alta Bates Summit Medical's Herrick Hospital site on Dwight Way.\nArreguin is submitting an item on March 14 to City Council which would enhance regulations around hospital closures. If approved, it would require \"appropriate notice\" of proposed closures of a hospital, clinic or out-patient facility that serves Berkeley, as well as public hearings before any closure.\nArreguin said he is also organizing an Alta Bates Regional Taskforce meeting slated for March 16 which would include representatives from UC Berkeley whose faculty and students depend on Alta Bates.\nThe press conference at which Senator Skinner announced the bill, was broadcast live on Facebook.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "With new bill, campaign to retain Alta Bates, avoid 'hospital deserts,' heats up", "Tags": "['Alta Bates Summit Hospital', 'Bateman neighborhood', 'Herrick Hospital', 'Jesse Arreguin', 'Nancy Skinner', 'South Berkeley', 'Sutter Health', 'The Elmwood']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Health']", "Natural Language Location": "Alta Bates Hospital; West Contra Costa", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.855109", "Zip Code": "94705", "ID": "249697", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.25343", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/01/new-bill-campaign-retain-alta-bates-avoid-hospital-deserts-heats/", "Author": "Tracey Taylor", "Date": "2017-03-01T15:00:24-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "More than 100 \"South Shattuck\" neighbors turned out to ask City Council to strike down Berkeley Honda's relocation plans at the Feb. 7 meeting. Photo: Emilie RagusoAt its 12th public hearing, Berkeley Honda's planned move to the old Any Mountain building at 2777 Shattuck Ave. finally got the green light at Berkeley City Council Tuesday night.\nThree weeks ago, five hours of public comment and council discussion was not enough to break a deadlock. On Tuesday, however, a motion by Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin to remand the project to the Zoning Adjustments Board in the hope of finding a compromise between Berkeley Honda and community opponents failed to win a majority (Arreguin, Sophie Hahn, Cheryl Davila and Ben Bartlett voted in favor of the motion, but the four votes did not constitute a majority on the eight-member council). As a result, Berkeley Honda will get its permit automatically next week - 30 days after the Feb. 7 council meeting.\nIn November 2014, Berkeley Honda left its longtime location at 2600 Shattuck Ave. to make way for a large mixed-use development called Parker Place currently under construction. After struggling since 2008 to find an appropriate new location, the business has said it came to an agreement with the property owner of 2777 Shattuck after Any Mountain requested an early termination of its lease there.\nRead Berkeleyside's full coverage of the Berkeley Honda project.Once again, a long line of local residents delivered more than one hour of comments Tuesday, largely opposed to the project.\n\n\"They say the California attorney general's office is the largest law firm in the world,\" said Bartlett after the public comment. \"Well, they've clearly never met the LeConte neighborhood.\"\nSeveral public commenters vowed to take legal action to stop the project. One discussion point at the council was a flawed notice of the public hearing: only 12 days notice was given (rather than the statutory 14) and a wrong date was on one part of the notice. Bartlett and Hahn proposed a motion at the meeting to continue the hearing to another date, to avoid possible litigation over the flawed notice. The motion failed.\nCity attorney Zach Cowan said at the meeting his view was that the technical problems with the notice did not cause any harm in this case. He thought it was unlikely that they could be used successfully for legal action.\nCouncilman Kriss Worthington said he thought it was \"repeatedly clear\" that the law allowed the Berkeley Honda project. As he argued on Feb. 7, he said city planning and policy had cleared the way for the move.\n\"I'm being asked to do the same thing that the old guard did and it's not ethical,\" Worthington said. \"It's not political, it's not personal.\"\nHahn, who made clear her opposition to the project on Feb. 7 with a 15-minute speech, slightly mangled her Shakespeare in response.\n\"Methinks he doth protest too much,\" she said.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Berkeley Honda gets go-ahead for move after 12th public hearing", "Tags": "[]", "Sections": "['Business', 'Business', 'City', 'Real Estate']", "Natural Language Location": "2777 Shattuck Ave", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.859281", "Zip Code": "94705", "ID": "249795", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.266545", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/01/berkeley-honda-gets-go-ahead-move-12th-public-hearing/", "Author": "Lance Knobel", "Date": "2017-03-01T13:07:26-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "The Obama administration, the California Legislative Analyst's office, and an overwhelming majority of housing experts agree: building housing at all income levels is the best way to address the affordability crisis. Kate Harrison, who is running for the District 4 Berkeley City Council seat, rejects this wealth of scholarship and policy analysis because, as she put it \"I just simply think the research does not show that.\"\nWhen climate change deniers ignore data and research, we rightly call them out. Berkeley voters should reject Kate Harrison to prevent Berkeley from enacting housing policies based on a similar brand of willful ignorance.\nHarrison's own words and actions demonstrate startling inconsistency on housing issues.\nAt the Sept. 30, 2015 Zoning Adjustments Board meeting, Harrison stated, \"I like tall buildings. I like development\"-- even as she actively fought a 300-unit LEED Gold project that will provide $10 million for affordable housing. Harrison continues to claim she wasn't against the project itself. But just last month, at a League of Women Voters forum, Harrison explicitly stated that she is against tall buildings near BART. These are not the words or deeds of someone who we can trust to encourage the housing creation Berkeley so desperately needs.\nHarrison has repeatedly mischaracterized and smeared her opponent through strawman attacks. At another recent candidates' forum, Harrison repeatedly criticized the idea of \"trickle-down housing\" and \"just building market-rate housing\" -- even though neither candidate supports this approach. The other candidate in the race, Ben Gould, has repeatedly called for more housing at all income levels and is a strong supporter of the City's affordable housing requirements. By attacking positions that no one in the race actually supports, Harrison is trying to distract from the deficiencies of her own housing policies.\nHarrison claims to agree with Gould on the importance of creating more affordable units, but Harrison's approach offers no workable mechanism for achieving Berkeley's affordable housing goals. To meet the city's current goal for low-income housing, Berkeley would need to build a total of 974 low-income housing units over eight years. The total cost of developing this many units would be roughly $300 million dollars, or $38 million per year. Harrison points to the recent \"landlord tax\" as a solution, but this tax only brings in about $3 million to $4 million per year-- a mere tenth of what's needed. Even with federal and state funds, making up the difference would require a significant tax increase or a big hit to the rest of the City budget. Harrison's policies cannot deliver on her promises.\nAlternatively, by building housing at all income levels and applying existing affordability requirements, Berkeley could meet our targets for low-income units at no additional cost to Berkeley taxpayers. Harrison has made it clear, though, that she supports policies that would slow down housing creation -- whether through impractical building standards, excessive project-by-project negotiation, or outright opposition to more housing.\nHarrison has also relied on incorrect and cherry-picked data to back up her positions. For instance, Harrison claimed that Berkeley has \"met 300% of the regional standard for market-rate housing.\" This is simply not true: Berkeley is nowhere near completing 4,203 units since 2014 (we have permitted about 3,000 units in that time). Furthermore, Berkeley has added 5,500 jobs and hundreds of students over the past six years. We therefore have a considerable deficit to make up for both market-rate and affordable housing. If Harrison were truly pro-housing, she would celebrate the progress we've made toward addressing these deficits, instead of complaining that we've somehow built too much housing.\nHarrison seems to believe that a \"regional approach\" to tackling these long-term housing deficits means that it's the responsibility of every city but Berkeley to encourage housing at all income levels. This finger-pointing approach is precisely what got us into the housing crisis, as most Bay Area cities tried to pawn off their responsibility to build housing for their workforces. Harrison tries to make it sound like Berkeley is being asked to shoulder the housing burden of places like San Francisco. But building more housing in Berkeley isn't about picking up slack for other cities; it's about taking care of the people who already work right here in Berkeley. By the city's own estimates, less than 20 percent of Berkeley's workforce actually lives in Berkeley. Contrary to Harrison's statements, building more housing in Berkeley isn't about \"new people coming in and saying we're a transit corridor.\" It's about meeting our own basic ethical obligation to house the people who help make Berkeley such an exciting, diverse, and prosperous place.\nIn the end, Berkeley voters can't trust Kate Harrison to deliver affordable housing because her approach is woefully unrealistic and ultimately hostile to new housing. I hope you will join me in supporting more housing at all income levels in Berkeley by voting for Ben Gould for City Council on or before March 7th.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Op-ed: Kate Harrison makes false promises on housing affordability", "Tags": "['Ben Gould', 'Berkeley City Council election', 'Berkeley elections', 'Berkeley politics', 'District 4', 'Downtown Berkeley', 'Election 2016 Berkeley', 'Kate Harrison']", "Sections": "['2016 Election', '2016 Election', 'Downtown', 'Opinion', 'Politics']", "Natural Language Location": "voting district 4", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.86968", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "249780", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.270894", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/01/op-ed-kate-harrison-makes-false-promises-housing-affordability/", "Author": "Guest contributor", "Date": "2017-03-01T11:44:28-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "The University Laundry on Shattuck and Blake was owned and operated by five Japanese-American families in the early part of the 20th century. Photo: California JapantownsA little more than a week after the 75th anniversary of Executive Order 9066, in which President Franklin Roosevelt created military exclusion zones that forced Americans of Japanese ancestry to report to detention camps, a Berkeley historian is asking that a former laundry operated by five families be landmarked.\nSteve Finacom filed an application recently to landmark 2526-30 Shattuck Ave., a two-story commercial building at the intersection of Blake Street. The building was built in 1897, making this 120-year old structure a \"rare survivor of Berkeley's early commercial era, when what was then a small town was dotted with one and two story wood frame, \"pioneer\" or Victorian commercial buildings,\" according to Finacom's application with the Landmarks Preservation Commission.\nThe building at 2526-32 Shattuck Ave. as it is now. Photo: Steve FinacomWhile the structure's physical attributes - many of which have been obscured by a modern application of stucco - have historic value, its uses over the years also reflect Berkeley's history, according to the application. The French immigrant Jean Bernadou established a laundry on the ground floor soon after the building was constructed. Jacques (Jack) Jaymot, another Frenchmen, took over the business in 1909, according to Finacom.\nLaundries in the late 19th and early 29th centuries were often identified by nationality to indicate their cleaning methods. French laundries often used French or German soaps to clean, wrote Finacom.\n\n\"French laundries generally had the reputation of doing fine detailed handwork including washing lace and getting white cloth items -- like men's shirt collars, and table clothes -- spotlessly clean and white, as well as delicates such as undergarments,\" wrote Finacom.\nIn 1914, five Japanese-American families -- the Fujiis, Kimbaras, Imamuras, Tsubamotos and Tokunagas -- banded together to open the University Laundry at 2526-30 Shattuck Ave. The individual families had all owned their own laundries and then formed a partnership. The families lived upstairs and shared a kitchen, dining room and living room, and worked on the ground floor.\n\"Japanese and Chinese laundries had the reputation of doing quality washing work, at lower price than many other commercial laundries,\" wrote Finacom.\nThe five families operating the University Laundry were part of a thriving Japanese community in Berkeley. Despite years of discriminatory immigration practices and redlining in Berkeley, the community had grown to about 1,300 by the time the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, prompting the U.S. to enter the war.\n\"There were 28 different organizations, churches and private schools serving this community,\" Robert Yamada writes in his book, The Japanese American Experience: the Berkeley Legacy, 1895-1995. \"In addition to those working as domestics and laborers, and gardeners in the communities, there were now over 70 separate businesses owned and operated by Japanese in Berkeley. There were 12 doctors, dentists, and lawyers, 12 grocery stores, over 17 flower shops and nurseries, and 6 laundries, 6 shoe repair shops, 6 cleaning establishments and several rooming houses and bath houses. A way of living had been formed in the community. The Japanese were applauded for not rocking the boat, for doing well academically, for being hard working and honest, and in not causing any trouble. They had the lowest crime rate for any minority group and all in all, in their in their place, were seen as an asset to the community.\"\nThe five families that operated the University Laundry learned to live and work together. Finacom excerpts part of a 1986 memoir written by John Noaki Fujii, the son of one of the University Laundry's founding families.\n\"Since the partners along with their wives and children all shared the upstairs living quarters together, the group developed a common communal life-style,\" wrote Fuji. \"All the adults worked long hours every day, usually six days a week. The women rotated kitchen and cooking duties periodically and child care was combined and shared...Among the men, each partner took responsibility for a part of the business. For example, Kurasaburo took care of the heavy washing and starching of clothes. The Imamuras did ironing and much of the mangle work. Mr. Kimbara went out to pick up and deliver laundry, In the first few years, pick up and deliveries were done using horse drawn wagons. Thus, two horses along with the wagons were maintained in the yard and barn at the rear of the building.\"\nThat changed in February 1942 with Executive Order 9066, which established \"military exclusion zones,\" including the West Coast. The first and second-generation Japanese residents were forced to abandon their homes and businesses because the federal government suspected their Japanese ancestry meant they might be loyal to Japan. They were sent to concentration camps around the west. The five families were no exception.\n\"Kurasaburo and his two remaining partners, Kimball and Imamura, dissolved their progressing laundry business as best they could, virtually abandoning their tens of thousands of dollars in capital investments,\" wrote Fujii. \"The laundry would be lost, their investment would never be recovered. With only hand-carried luggage, the Japanese evacuees, including the Fujiis, were all taken to the Tanforan relocation assembly center on April 29, 1942.\"\nConsequently, the building is an important representation of the past, said Finacom.\n\"The story of the Fujiis and the other Japanese-American families in establishing lives, homes, and businesses in Berkeley mirrored the experience of many other Japanese-Americans,\" Finacom wrote in the application. \"The University Laundry building is a tangible and physical reminder of this story and part of Berkeley history, as well as the broader history of discrimination against, and accomplishments of, Japanese-Americans.\nIn the 1950s, the building housed the Nash Berkeley car dealership, operated by Gil Ashcom, said Finacom. In the 1960s, there was a coin-operated laundry there. In 2014, the building caught fire and eight people were displaced. At the time there was a massage parlor and the MG Enhancez Hair Shop at the site. The owners of the structure, Tsui Shen and Yeu B. Wu of Kensington, have repaired the building, which is now vacant, , according to Finacom.

Photo: Allen RabinovichUpdate, Monday, March 13: The city of Berkeley says the property owner has sought, and received, a two-week extension to complete the inspection and report required by the city following the mysterious deaths of a young couple and their cats in a South Berkeley apartment in January. City spokesman Matthai Chakko said Monday that, in exchange for the extension, the city required the property owner to shut off the gas to all appliances in the unit at 3028 Deakin where the tragedy took place. Berkeleyside will continue to follow the story.\nOriginal story, Feb. 28, 9 a.m. The apartment where a young Berkeley couple and their cats were found dead in January has been \"red tagged\" by city staff, and the building owner has been directed to have the unit inspected by a licensed contractor before anyone can live there again.\nThe process, which is called an \"unsafe building notice,\" is typically used after earthquake damage or fires, city spokesman Matthai Chakko told Berkeleyside on Monday.\nRoger and Val Morash, 35 and 32 years old, were found dead in their home, along with their two pet cats, at 3028 Deakin St. on Jan. 23. Since then, the city has been trying to figure out what led to those fatalities.\n\nThe Berkeley Police Department, which initially classified the matter as \"suspicious\" due to its unusual circumstances, concluded that carbon monoxide caused the tragic deaths. But the source of the carbon monoxide has not been identified.\nLast week, BPD handed its investigation over to the city's Building and Safety Division, Chakko said, in response to a Berkeleyside query.\nThursday, city staff posted a red placard on the unit where the couple died to make it clear it is unsafe to enter.\nNow, the property owner is required to have a mechanical engineer, or a mechanical contractor licensed in California, inspect the unit and evaluate it to determine what sort of unsafe conditions might have contributed to the presence of carbon monoxide.\n\"Nobody is allowed to occupy that unit until the city gets this report,\" Chakko said. \"There are still questions about the unit.\"\nThe city had PG&E and the Berkeley Fire Department conduct multiple tests in the Morash's unit, but the results were inconclusive. The tests took place on more than one occasion.\nLast week, the city offered to test the other three units in the building, though the red placard only applies to the one where the couple died.

Spencer Fomby (left) speaks to a crowded room at the Starry Plough about crime-related concerns. Photo: Emilie RagusoBerkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin and Councilman Ben Bartlett have promised to increase police staffing and revive a recently disbanded specialized crime suppression unit to help address neighborhood concerns about safety following a spate of recent robberies in South Berkeley and the Elmwood District.\nRead more about robberies in BerkeleyBoth officials tried to reassure local residents, many of whom expressed fear and frustration at the apparent uptick in crime, at a standing-room-only community meeting at the Starry Plough on Saturday. Bartlett, who was elected in November to represent South Berkeley, organized the meeting in response to constituent concerns about public safety.\nOne attendee summed up the largely unified message in the room for police and city officials: \"In the 16 years I've lived here, this is unprecedented. We need a solution to this problem now.\" Though 2017 has only just begun, Saturday's meeting was the second large community turnout related to an increase in serious crime. In late January, hundreds of South and West Berkeley residents came together in San Pablo Park following multiple shootings in the neighborhood.\nThe Starry Plough turnout was smaller -- perhaps 100-150 people -- and more informal than the meeting at the park. But attendees were vocal in their demands for action. To kick off Saturday's meeting, Bartlett asked several local residents to testify about how crime has impacted their lives. He had no trouble finding volunteers. Later in the afternoon, local self-defense school Krav Maga Xtreme demonstrated techniques to ward off attacks. And a Berkeley police sergeant fielded questions about BPD's approach to crime prevention.\n\nMany meeting attendees expressed support for law enforcement and said they want to see a greater police presence in Berkeley. Some speakers advocated for increased programs for youth and more reliance on grassroots neighborhood efforts that do not depend on law enforcement. But most of the community members who spoke said they support the police and want to see more of them.\nOne woman shared the story of her neighbor who was knocked out one night during a mugging a month or so ago. He stumbled home, she said, and didn't know what had happened to him.\n\"He didn't realize he'd been knocked out,\" she said. \"It's scary. We need more police visibility, please.\"\n\nAnother man said his neighbors, who are in their 70s, had gotten in their car recently after having tea with a friend when a robber confronted the female half of the couple.\n\"A man walked up to her with a gun, opened the door ... pointed the gun in her face and asked her to give him her purse,\" he said. \"She and her husband were both traumatized from the experience.\"\nLocal resident Dave Fogarty described having been robbed at gunpoint a month or so ago on Woolsey Street near Shattuck Avenue after working at a favorite South Berkeley cafe.\nFogarty said he was walking home at 2 p.m., on a beautiful day, when a car pulled up to him. A man jumped out and stuck a revolver in his face before demanding his backpack, then taking his wallet and phone and ordering him to get on the ground. Fogarty said it was all over within 35 seconds or so, and that he didn't get a good look at the robber. \"All I could really focus on was the barrel of that gun.\"\nFogarty said he thought it was just a random experience until he read on Berkeleyside that there had been 34 robberies in January alone. This was followed by a night in Berkeley with at least six robberies, and an armed robbery at Espresso Roma where patrons fought back to try to ward off the criminals.\n\"It's like the Wild West,\" Fogarty said. \"It's a little crazy.\"\nResidents also expressed concern about the unsuccessful manhunt -- possibly in connection with a series of cafe robberies -- involving the Oakland and Berkeley police departments earlier this month. \"Enough is enough\" seemed to be the overall sentiment in the room. \"Come back with a real strategy,\" Fogarty told Councilman Bartlett and Mayor Arreguin. \"How are you going to stop this?\"\n\nBartlett said the city is already working to create more opportunities for the disenfranchised, to make its hiring policies more inclusive, and to attempt to address homelessness. But he said the city must also do more, on the enforcement side, to prevent violent crime.\nBartlett shared his own story about a family friend -- a single mother of two -- who had been robbed and assaulted recently on her way home from BART. She'd just gotten a job after being unemployed for an extended period.\n\"He hit her in the head with a pistol, put her in a coma,\" Bartlett said. \"She was in the hospital for three days.\"\nWhen she got out, she had lost her new job. She'd been living in a rented room with her kids. That fell through and she moved into her car. Six weeks ago, her car got towed. Now, Bartlett said, she's in a shelter and has been separated from her children. The robber, he added, got $7 in that mugging.\n\"This is violence. It destroys lives and disrupts dreams,\" he said. \"It's not acceptable.\"\nCouncilman Ben Bartlett (left), who organized Saturday's meeting, spoke with community members after the event. Photo: Emilie RagusoBartlett continued: \"This neighborhood should not be the place where violence is home,\" he said. \"We are not put here to be anybody's prey.\"\nSgt. Spencer Fomby, who helps oversee the BPD Community Services Bureau and is on the department's Special Response Team, told those in attendance most armed robberies in Berkeley tend to happen near campus and downtown.\n\"South Berkeley is not the typical target,\" he said. An average year in Berkeley sees about 300-400 robberies. He said robberies are very difficult to prevent, and described them as one of the highest-priority crimes in Berkeley, second only to shootings. Catching robberies in progress, he added, is exceedingly difficult.\n\"It happens really fast. The next thing you know, that person is gone,\" he said, adding that, without robust descriptions, \"it's like a needle in a haystack to locate that car and locate those suspects.\"\nIn response to a question about the prevalence of gangs in Berkeley, or their connection to robberies, Fomby said they are \"no longer operating in the same way\" as far as street crime, noting, \"Their business model has changed.\"\nHe continued: \"People don't like to see cops flooding the area, stopping everything moving. And we are sensitive to that. We want to make sure we are stopping the people involved in violent crime.... We know how to go in and be surgical and not impact anybody else.\"\nBartlett said the right tool for that job is a special police unit that suppresses street violence. And he said that's a solution he supports and wants to see put in place.\nMore than 100 people attended Saturday's crime prevention meeting at the Starry Plough. Photo: Emilie RagusoFomby said BPD used to have that kind of team -- the Drug Task Force -- but it was disbanded. He said the team would go into neighborhoods and get to know the players involved in crime and drug dealing. Officers worked to identify those individuals and also to intervene: to build relationships to try to help get people on more productive pathways, such as school and jobs.\nCommunity members said they wanted to know what they could do to push the city back in that direction to help increase safety on Berkeley streets.\n\"There are people in the community who are very vocal in their opposition to police officers being proactive,\" Fomby said.\n\"Nobody here!\" shouted a man in the crowd.\n\"We appreciate the support that you've given, and we need that enthusiasm,\" Fomby said.\nOne woman said neighbors already work together through associations and via social network NextDoor -- which they should keep doing -- but that police must be willing to collaborate and communicate with local residents, too.\n\"We are being targeted in Berkeley because, I have to assume, there isn't enough deterrence, and we've got a lot of goodies,\" she said. \"We have phones and we have laptops and we have purses. I've had my wallet stolen out of my purse twice at Whole Foods. How cool is that? It's not cool. I am ready to work with you guys to do some bigger, better, smarter actions on the prevention side. We cannot be a wimpy target.\"\nSgt. Fomby passed around this map of robberies in Berkeley in 2017. Photo: Emilie RagusoCrime in Berkeley spiked by double digits in 2015, then appeared to fall again in the first half of 2016. Put another way, in 2015, serious crimes in Berkeley were at their highest level since they peaked in 2009. The annual crime report for 2016 is coming up before council in March. Trend data for early 2017 won't be reported by BPD until September.\nMeeting attendees said they'd like to see patrol cars more often, want officers to spend more time walking the beat, and want to have an easier time with dispatch when they call in to report crimes they witness, such as drug sales.\nIn closing remarks, Mayor Arreguin told attendees he and Councilman Bartlett are committed to putting in place a plan to increase resources \"so we have a visible police presence.\" He described the BPD force as \"incredible,\" but said the department has struggled due to limited staffing for patrol and to respond to crime adequately.\n\"That is something we will begin to address, to expand the force,\" Arreguin said.\nHe said he and Bartlett are also exploring, with BPD Chief Andy Greenwood, the possibility of a crime suppression team focused on violent crime and crime trends. The team, he added, is something \"we want to put in place immediately, as quickly as we can.\" He said after the meeting that it would take a council vote to bring back that team, and that the item would need to go on a future council agenda, as yet unscheduled, for discussion and a vote.\nMany community members were excited about the choice of location for Saturday's meeting, saying they appreciated access to beer and snacks at the Starry Plough. Photo: Emilie RagusoBPD's Drug Task Force, which was part of the Special Enforcement Unit, was \"retired\" in early 2016 with little public fanfare. In the 1980s, the Drug Task Force was created to deal with Berkeley's open air drug markets and associated violence. It started out with three sergeants and 15 officers. Police officials told council last year that the task force had become smaller and smaller over the years because \"the drug hot spots were a mere shadow of what they once were.\"\nA sergeant and two officers on the Drug Task Force were reassigned to patrol to help cover the beats better as the department works on a longer-term strategy to increase overall staffing, which has been on the decline for years. Other members of the task force, the Special Investigations Bureau, moved into the Detectives Division to work on investigations.\n\"The Bureau will continue to investigate narcotics trafficking, while broadening its attention to investigating crime series, focusing on serious violent felonies, dangerous offenders, and other investigations as needed,\" according to a crime report to the City Council in April. Details about the size of that bureau have not been publicized.\nSome have said the Drug Task Force, known colloquially in the neighborhoods as \"task,\" was disbanded due to political pressure. The Berkeley NAACP lauded the break-up of the unit, due to what some have said was its undue and inequitable scrutiny on minority neighborhoods. But other community members have said it was an important crimefighting tool, and have told Berkeleyside its loss was \"disheartening.\" Officers have told Berkeleyside that it has become more difficult to serve search warrants and do other more specialized operations now that the unit is no longer an option.\nMayor Arreguin told attendees at Saturday's meeting that the discussion was a first step in making Berkeley safer. He said he and Bartlett want to work directly with neighbors to turn their idea.s about how to move forward on crime prevention, into reality.\n\"This is unacceptable that anyone in our community should be victimized,\" Arreguin said. \"We will be doing what we can to expand resources so that we can effectively address the increase in robberies and assaults that are plaguing our community.\"\nWatch Berkeleyside's Facebook live video of the second portion of the meeting.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Berkeley mayor, councilman pledge to increase police resources", "Tags": "['Ben Bartlett', 'Berkeley crime', 'Berkeley Police', 'Berkeley robberies', 'Guns in Berkeley', 'Jesse Arreguin', 'Public safety', 'South Berkeley', 'Southside Berkeley', 'Spencer Fomby', 'Starry Plough', 'The Elmwood']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Crime', 'Crime & Safety']", "Natural Language Location": "South Berkeley and the Elmwood District.", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.858972", "Zip Code": "94705", "ID": "249514", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.254418", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/27/berkeley-mayor-councilman-pledge-increase-police-resources/", "Author": "Emilie Raguso", "Date": "2017-02-27T13:30:30-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "A lawsuit has been filed over the landmarking of 2508 Ridge Road. In the photograph, note the \"two brick chimneys with flared tops,\" which are highlighted as a feature to be preserved. Photo: Daniella ThompsonA longstanding Berkeley-based commercial real estate firm is suing the city over its use of landmark status to protect a Northside housing complex, alleging \"a lack of supporting evidence\" to justify the designation, which raises the bar for structural changes once applied.\nThe lawsuit, filed Wednesday on behalf of Rue-Ell Enterprises, Inc., focuses on 2508 Ridge Road, one block north of the UC Berkeley campus. According to the suit, property owner Rue-Ell was given minimal time to review and analyze the lengthy landmarking application and got insufficient time to make its own case before the city to fight the designation.\nThe lawsuit takes issue with the landmarking itself and says Rue-Ell was denied due process.\nAccording to Rue-Ell, the landmarking was \"not based on any facts or accepted architectural rules, but rather on matters not relevant nor germane to the architectural or historical features of the property and were neither reasonable in nature nor of solid value.\"\n\nThe property at issue is a 15-unit complex called the Bennington Apartments, which was built in 1892 but has changed significantly since then. Rue-Ell bought the Ridge Road property in the 1960s, according to the landmark application. There is no application on file with the city to alter the building.\n\"An unusual porch with a wood-beamed ceiling is located at the southwestern corner of the lower level. It is defined by two stucco-clad round, tapered columns surmounted by wooden beams and supporting the rear wing of the building.\" Photo: Daniella ThompsonThe city's Landmarks Preservation Commission conferred landmark status on the building in February 2016 -- based on a 73-page application by Daniella Thompson, a Berkeley resident and architectural historian who is the editor for the Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association. The LPC initiated the process to consider the structure for landmarking, according to city records.\nAccording to Thompson's landmark application, \"The 10,735-square-foot frame building consists of two stories above street grade and one story below. It is clad in unpainted wood shingles and surmounted by a series of gable- and cross-gable roofs clad in composition shingles. Two flared brick chimneys crown the roof ridge.\"\nThe LPC found the building worthy of landmark status because of its \"highly unusual hybrid style that is unique on the Northside,\" according to city documents, and said it was the \"only extant relic of 19th century Euclid Avenue.\"\nThe Berkeley City Council upheld that designation in October, following an appeal by Rue-Ell, though it tweaked the language to make it more general. The appeal -- filed by the same attorney who is handling the lawsuit -- said the LPC decision was without evidence, and that the decision to landmark the structure was \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\nThe landmarking application described the building as \"one of the three oldest known brown-shingle buildings in Berkeley,\" but council struck out that language when it upheld the LPC decision.\nThe landmark application continues, \"On this radically transformed block, the Bennington Apartments serve as a palpable reminder of Daley's Scenic Park's earliest days.\" The Scenic Park tract was created in 1889. It ran from what's now Hearst Avenue up to Cedar Street, and from Arch Street east to Highland Place.\nRear wing, September 2015. Source: Daniella ThompsonAccording to the landmark application,  \"Of the six pre-1923 buildings still standing on the 2500 block of Ridge Road, three have been altered beyond recognition. North Gables, the significantly modified but still recognizable Victorian at 2531 Ridge Road, is the only other remnant from the 1890s. The first decade of the 20th century is represented by the very badly altered Blossom house (1904) on the corner of Le Roy Avenue, and by the intact four-story Treehaven Apartments, at 2523 Ridge Road.\"\nUnder the city code, according to the lawsuit, architectural merit is conferred on properties that are the first, last, only or most significant type of their kind \"in the region.\" The lawsuit argues that the Northside neighborhood alone, specifically the \"Daley's Scenic Park\" tract identified in the landmark application, is \"hardly a region\" and therefore fails to comply with the code requirements.\nThe lawsuit says there have been \"substantial changes\" to the Bennington Apartments, which were originally two buildings on Euclid that were later moved and joined together with stucco.\n\"Clad in unpainted gray stucco, most of the lower level was built as connective tissue in 1915, when the two houses were combined,\" according to the landmark application. A fire in 1923 destroyed many brown-shingle homes on Euclid north of Ridge, leaving this the \"only extant relic\" of that time, the application concluded.\nSignificant facade changes followed the move, and defining features -- including brown shingle cladding and a decorative balcony railing -- were replaced, according to the lawsuit.\n\"Until 2007, the balcony above the left part of the porch featured an elegant wooden balustrade,\" the landmark application reads. \"Regrettably, this First Bay Region Tradition feature was replaced with a solid parapet.... Another lost feature is the previous wooden screen on the porch, replaced with off-the-shelf latticework.\"\nDaley's Scenic Park tract map, filed 26 August 1889. Source: Landmark applicationAccording to the landmark application, \"The Bennington Apartments combine a rare 19th-century Shingle Style street facade with Arts & Crafts elements along the west elevation. The latter include notable architectural details such as a circular stucco wall, handsome glazed doors and arched windows, and robust tapered columns. This highly unusual hybrid style is unique on the Northside and possibly in all of Berkeley.\"\nRead Daniella Thompson's 2007 story about the Bennington Apartments via BAHABut the lawsuit takes issues with those conclusions, arguing that the structure was \"patched together\" from two different buildings of different styles, moved from one spot to another, built at different times, designed by unknown architects, built by unknown builders, significantly modified on the exterior and substantially obscured from street view.\nThat's not to say the building isn't special. A recent rental listing for a unit at 2508 Ridge describes it as \"Super Charming,\" with \"beautiful hardwood floors,\" a fireplace, built-in bookcases and \"Older Style Light Fixtures.\" \"The Ridge Road Apartments is one of North Berkeley's Charming Brown Shingled Building,\" the ad continues. \"As you would expect from this 1910's building it has really unique architectural features. In addition, its fantastic location can't be beat.\"\nSome historical figures also had ties to the property, the landmrk application says. One of those was Frank Wilson, who owned one of the houses that later became the Bennington. Wilson was a \"proprietor and chief promoter of the Daley's Scenic Park tract, a civic and business leader, and a patron of charities, the arts, and the University.\" He was close to U.C. President Benjamin Wheeler, U.C. Regent Phoebe Hearst, and campus architect John Galen Howard, \"all of whom became his immediate neighbors.\"\nLots for sale in \"East Berkeley,\" as in the San Francisco Call, Dec. 9, 1891. Source: Landmark applicationAccording to the landmark application, the Bennington was built by William and Mary Henry, \"pioneers in the early commercial development of Euclid Avenue and the parents of Aurelia Henry Reinhardt, who herself was a resident of the Bennington Apartments from the time the building opened in 1915 until she was elected president of Mills College in 1916 and moved to Oakland.\"\nThe lawsuit says the significance of those ties is tenuous -- \"Nothing about the structure embodies the history of these individuals\" -- and that council abused its discretion when it upheld the LPC's landmark designation. The suit asks the court to make the city set aside the designation and pay for lawsuit costs, and for unlimited \"further relief.\"\n\"The City's findings cited no facts to support the conclusion of historic value,\" wrote attorney Steven Piser, who filed the lawsuit for Rue-Ell, adding, \"'Hybrid' is not an architectural style.\"\nRue-Ell is part of a commercial property leasing company in Berkeley that dates back to the 50s.\nAccording to its website, \"Our corporation was initially formed in 1958 as a car seat covering business by college student David Ruegg. He and longtime friend Robert Ellsworth became partners in 1960 and delved into several different investment interests before settling on commercial real estate. For over 50 years, these two Berkeley natives have operated their businesses on a handshake.\"\nThe city of Berkeley does not comment on pending litigation.\nLandmark designation can happen in Berkeley through the City Council, the Planning and Civic Arts commissions, or by property owners themselves. The only other way to request landmark status is through an application brought by at least 50 residents of Berkeley, according to the city code.\nThe filing fee to initiate the landmarking of a building is $100.\nSince January 2015, according to the Planning Department, there have been nine landmark initiation applications filed.\nTwo of those were denied -- at 2556 Telegraph Ave. (The Village) and 2777 Shattuck Ave. (Berkeley Honda) -- and two were approved, at 3031-3051 Adeline St. and 2508 Ridge (above). Five others are pending.\n[Update: Thompson reached out to Berkeleyside after publication to say \"The list reproduced from the City of Berkeley is both incomplete and out of date. It doesn't show the Yazdi Building, 2910-2912 Telegraph Avenue, designated on 7 July 2016, and it lists the Captain Slater House, 1335 Shattuck Avenue, as pending, when it was designated on 2 February 2017. Altogether, five landmarks were designated since the beginning of 2015, including the Channing Apartments, 2409 College Avenue, which were initiated on 4 December 2014 and designated on 5 February 2015.\" Landmarks designated by year can be seen on the BAHA webpage.]\nThe landmarking process is generally not undertaken by the property owner.\nSince January 2015, at least four of the nine applications were initiated by the Landmarks Preservation Commission, while two were submitted by local historian Steve Finacom. Thompson's name was listed as the applicant on two, though one of those -- at 1335 Shattuck, north of Rose Street -- indicated in notes that it too came through the LPC.\nThompson said after publication, however, that the city records are not correct.\n\"I was the applicant on all five successful applications since the beginning of 2015 (one of them, the Yazdi Building, in partnership with Steven Finacom),\" she said, by email. \"In all but one of those cases, I asked the LPC to initiate the properties in question, and the commission voted to do so.

He announced last month his plan to run for Senator Dianne Feinstein's seat in 2018.\n\"After the election people started talking more and more about how important it is for scientists to run for office,\" Eisen said.\nDonald Trump's election victory seems to have unlocked a new political awareness and activism in labs around the country. Scientists are speaking out against climate change skepticism and moves from the new administration they perceive as suppressing the free flow of information. They've have organized national marches on Earth Day, and there's even a new political action committee called 314 PAC to help scientists run for office.\n\nAt the American Association for Advancement of Science annual meeting earlier this month, John Holdren, chief science adviser to President Obama, urged scientists to tithe one-tenth of their time to public service, including activism. And Harvard historian of science Naomi Oreskes received a standing ovation at the same meeting when she urged scientists to get more politically engaged and to be \"sentinels\" for the public.\nThose same feelings are motivating Eisen. \"At some moment I basically said, 'Well, okay, that means me,'\" he said.\nEisen, who has no political experience, explains he's running because he thinks Washington needs to pay more attention to science and scientific thinking. \"I've long felt that we needed to change the way science is perceived by the public and policymakers,\" he said.\nNot quite the Senate Office Building: Door to Eisen's lab at UC Berkeley.

The House Committee on Space, Science and Technology has one engineer, four doctors, one computer scientist and one physicist out of 38 members. The Senate subcommittee that deals with science has no one with formal training in the field. Together, they oversee some of the agencies that spend the US's $135 billion research and development budget.\nA lack of scientific expertise in politics has frustrated him locally, too. Eisen, who says he votes Democrat but will probably run as an Independent, calls himself alienated from Berkeley politics. \"I find them to be frustratingly un-analytical,\" he says. He opposed the GMO labeling ordinance, for instance, and thinks he might have been the only one.\nHis campaign promise is that he'll approach every problem in Washington the way he would a problem in his lab. To him that means having an open mind, asking the right questions, weighing the evidence and being ready to question his own assumptions. Eisen doesn't plan to enter the campaign with a long list of policy positions.\n\"That would not be in keeping with my idea of how the world should work,\" he said. He doesn't plan to portray himself as an expert ready to address scientific policy, but as a person equipped to apply a scientific thought process to a whole range of questions. And he believes he can encourage lay people to see their own potential to think that way too.\nHe readily admits that he faces tough odds. \"I'm a scientist so I have to be realistic,\" he said with a laugh. \"If I were looking at the data and the evidence I would say I have little chance of winning.\"\nFor one, Feinstein has not said whether she plans to run again. She's in her fifth term as a U.S. senator, the second most senior Democrat in the chamber. She won her most recent election, in 2012, by 25 percentage points. And if she decided to retire instead, Eisen would undoubtedly be joining a crowded field jostling for one of the safer Democratic seats in the Senate.\nBut his biggest hurdle? He doesn't exactly know what he's doing.\n\"A lot of what happens in next six months determines if I'm quixotic outsider or can I mount serious campaign,\" he said.\nEisen's never held public office. He's not even sure how to register as a candidate. He ran once for student council in high school, and later to be on the board of the Genetics Society of America. He lost both elections. He says he's looking to groups like 314 PAC for guidance.\nStill, there is evidence to suggest scientists can have political success. Illinois Congressman Bill Foster, a Democrat, had a decades-long career as a research physicist. Rush Holt, who retired from his House seat in 2015 after 16 years representing New Jersey, was a physicist as well.\nHolt, now the CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, says we need more scientists in politics, both as candidates or advisors. And he says he's gotten more phone calls from scientists this year who are considering getting involved, although he hasn't spoken to Eisen himself.\nBut Holt, who badly lost his first primary election, cautions that it's not an easy road: \"I would say both campaigning and serving are by far the hardest things I've ever done, intellectually, psychologically and physically.\"\nAnd, he added, science is not a panacea. \"Politics and policymaking consists of more than science,\" he said. \"No one should go into this with the arrogance that they're smarter than anyone else or that their science will necessarily lead to better policies than anyone else.\"\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Biologist Michael Eisen plans Senate run to bring scientific thinking to Washington", "Tags": "[]", "Sections": "['Politics', 'Politics', 'Schools', 'UC Berkeley']", "Natural Language Location": "UC Berkeley", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.869861", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "249127", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.258765", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/22/biologist-michael-eisen-plans-senate-run-bring-scientific-thinking-washington/", "Author": "Sam Lemonick", "Date": "2017-02-22T09:00:06-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Yvette Felarca (right) was among the leaders of the December 2014 Black Lives Matter protests in Berkeley. Photo: Emilie RagusoThe Berkeley middle school teacher who made headlines this week after going on Fox News to defend the role of violent protest in shutting down \"racist, misogynistic and homophobic\" messages is asking her supporters to push back against the outpouring of calls that have come into the school district to have her fired.\nYvette Felarca, a teacher at Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School and a leader in the group By Any Means Necessary (BAMN), wrote to allies early Thursday morning saying she was \"In Need Of Your Support Once Again.\"\nRead full Berkeleyside coverage of the recent Berkeley protest and its aftermath.\"Fox News is waging a hysterical witch-hunt against me because of my prominence in the Bay Area movement against Trump and his Breitbart white supremacist backers,\" she wrote. \"The fact that I stood my ground against a Fox News demagogue-journalist was a surprising humiliation to him and the Fox News audience, and has driven several hundred Trump supporters into a frenzied attempt to create a new witch-hunt. They have made hundreds of calls to the Berkeley school administration attempting to frighten school officials into firing me.\"\nCharles Burress, Berkeley Unified School District spokesman, estimated that at least 1,000 emails and calls came in this week urging just that.\n\n\"They continue to come in,\" he said Thursday at about noon. Expressions of support, on the other hand, have been slim. Burress said one King parent called him directly to express support for Felarca, and that, as far as he knew, perhaps two email messages had come in to the district voicing a similar message.\nThe district has catalogued a long list of what it has characterized as possible grounds for dismissal dating back to 2009, but has been unable or unwilling to terminate Felarca's employment. Those allegations appear below on Berkeleyside for the first time.\nHer supporters have previously come out by the dozens to say Felarca is an excellent teacher who focuses on helping students learn how to stand up for themselves and stand up for their rights.\nIn her email Thursday, Felarca asked people to call the Berkeley School Board, and King Middle School directly, to \"let them know that you support me against the bullying and harassment by Trump's supporters.\"\nShe said they could also come to the Berkeley School Board meeting Wednesday, Feb. 22, to make their voices heard during public comment.\n\"As important as it is to me that I continue to teach the students whom I care about so deeply, it is even more important to the Berkeley community as a whole that the local school authorities not cave into the pressure of these right-wing extremists to get me fired,\" she wrote. \"This would represent a defeat for me and my students. It would also represent a defeat for the progressive values that hold our community together, and the national movement of millions of new activists fighting to defend those values all over the country against Trump and his bullies.\"\nYvette Felarca at a School Board meeting in October 2016. Image: BUSDIn a statement published on the School District website Wednesday, School Board President Ty Alper and BUSD Superintendent Donald Evans said they do not, and cannot, discuss personnel matters in public.\n\"Many have asked us whether the teacher in question will be disciplined for her political activities and for public statements she has made. As a public school district, we follow the law, including the U.S. and California Constitutions, the California Education Code, and our collective bargaining agreements,\" they wrote, continuing: \"It is important to emphasize that we firmly support the First Amendment right to free speech. We also strongly condemn the use of violence in confronting speech, even speech we might find abhorrent or counter to the values of our community.\"\nAs of publication time, a petition calling for Felarca to be fired had garnered more than 5,700 signatures, up from 4,000 about 24 hours earlier.\nFelarca has been involved in a public struggle with BUSD since September when the district placed her on paid leave following widespread reports and video showing her punching a man at a white nationalist rally in Sacramento in late June. The district did not say why it placed Felarca on leave, citing confidentiality laws, and ultimately brought Felarca back into the classroom in November following repeated protests at School Board meetings by her supporters.\nDistrict letter offers insight into contentious history\nIn October, Felarca filed a civil rights lawsuit against the district saying BUSD had interrogated her students, removed her from a staff meeting, and threatened to withhold funding, for longstanding programs, from colleagues who expressed support for her. Felarca described the district's actions as retaliatory and said they caused her to suffer \"panic attacks, repressed appetite, weight loss, dizziness, and increased emotional distress resulting from attacks by Defendants in this case.\"\nAccording to her complaint, BUSD's actions \"send a clear and dangerous message to BUSD teachers, staff, students, and parents that they will be witch-hunted and driven out of BUSD if they choose to act against racism and injustice and exercise their rights on their own time.\"\nFelarca has asked for a jury trial, a return of wages taken from her bank account, and compensatory and punitive damages \"in an amount according to proof and which is fair, just, and reasonable.\" The lawsuit is set to return to court in March.\nA district letter to Felarca, included in her complaint, sheds light on problems the district says it has dealt with in the past in relation to her work and activities. The 30-page letter documents allegations dating back to 2009. The letter said Felarca's performance \"reflected unprofessional conduct and unsatisfactory performance,\" and said both are grounds for dismissal.\nThe district cited six Education Code sections related to its notification letter, which was dated June 30, 2016: immoral conduct, evident unfitness for service, persistent violation of or refusal to obey school laws, dishonesty, unprofessional conduct and unsatisfactory performance.\nIn 2009, according to the letter, Felarca \"repeatedly solicited students to participate in protests\" against a proposed charter school BUSD was considering, despite having been formally reprimanded about involving students in her political activities, and pursuing those activities during the work day.\nFelarca was among the leaders of the December 2014 Black Lives Matter protests in Berkeley. Photo: Emilie RagusoIn 2011, she asked for permission to take her after-school club on an all-day field trip to UC Berkeley for activities related to Proposition 209. The school principal \"ultimately denied permission,\" according to the letter, because \"it was an opportunity for you to indoctrinate students and use them to support your own personal political agenda, it took them away from necessary instruction, and violated the directives you had been given in 2009.\"\nIn 2013, the district said Felarca repeatedly used leave time to attend immigrant rights marches in Washington, D.C., which BUSD said is not an allowable use for personal or sick leave. The district docked her pay and alerted her to the problem, according to the letter, but the behavior continued. When BUSD tried to schedule a private meeting with Felarca about the issue, \"employees in the District office were confronted with a loud group of over ten young people ... chanting and carrying signs\" to protest \"teacher harassment.\"\nIn the meeting, according to the letter, Felarca said she was being targeted and harassed, while the district said her \"abuse of personal leave has been significant and repeated multiple times over a few short months,\" contrary to the teacher contract: \"It was evident that your claims of 'harassment' and 'targeting' were an attempt to try to manipulate and bully District officials into not holding you accountable.\" Meanwhile, the students who had gathered entered district offices and were disruptive, and Felarca refused to answer questions about how the group knew about the meeting in the first place, according to the letter.\nFelarca later went on Facebook, according to BUSD, and thanked the picketers for their support, adding: \"I think the Administration is going to back down on the discipline, but they still plan to dock me another day's pay for attending the Andy Lopez march. We're gaining ground but the fight continues. Si se puede!\"\nThe Facebook post encouraged supporters to sign a petition that called Felarca a hero and role model, and said she should be allowed to use personal leave at her discretion. The district was not pleased.\n\"It is apparent from your Facebook posting that you enjoy defying the administration and taking an adversarial position against the administration of your employer,\" BUSD wrote. \"This is blatant insubordination and will not be tolerated.... Your Facebook posting and the petition also make clear that you are intentionally providing the readers with biased, slanted information.\"\nThe district said its issue with Felarca was her \"lack of compliance\" with BUSD rules and regulations: \"The verbiage of your post and petition which is embarrassingly narcissistic makes it clear that you were trying to provide readers only with information that would support you, not the actual facts.\"\nIt continues, \"it was evident that you and your [By Any Means Necessary] representatives were actively trying to brainwash and manipulate these young people to serve your own selfish interests in not being held accountable to the same rules that apply to everyone else. As a teacher, your conduct was particularly reprehensible.\"\nYvette Felarca was among the leaders of the December 2014 Black Lives Matter protests in Berkeley. Photo: Emilie RagusoBUSD said Felarca went on to email fellow King employees \"during District time, using the District's email distribution list\" to thank them for their support against \"BUSD's political harassment.\" She invited her co-workers to sign her petition or come to her classroom to learn more.\nAs a result, the district said Felarca had to comply with more stringent rules to justify any leave, and said time away would need to be in compliance with the teacher contract. The district said neither Felarca nor her supporters could use district resources to advocate for her cause, and that she could not use BAMN or discuss private personnel matters as part of a public campaign on her behalf.\nThe district said a parent of one of Felarca's former students later got in touch, in response to fliers being handed out at Berkeley High in support of Felarca, saying Felarca had previously \"marginalized Caucasian students\" in the classroom and \"did not present a balanced view of controversial issues in the classroom.\"\n\"Under no circumstances may you try to present material to students in a biased and one-sided manner in order to try to influence or indoctrinate students into a particular way of of thinking,\" BUSD wrote. \"You are to treat all students equally regardless of their ethnicity.\"\nThe letter also instructs Felarca to avoid using \"a defiant, rude or insubordinate tone\" with district staff, and says, \"You are not to lie or engage in any type of dishonesty,\" or \"try to bully or manipulate District officials.\" The district said she had to remove her petition and any posts related to \"this confidential personnel matter\" from her Facebook page, the BAMN website and \"other on-line locations available to the public.\"\nListen to remarks by Felarca at a Black Lives Matter protest in Berkeley in 2014.The district said Felarca again mis-used leave in November and December 2014 to protest, in part, UC regents during regular school hours. Various media covered an event Nov. 20 where BUSD said Felarca spoke to students and during public comment at a meeting, as documented on YouTube and by the Associated Press. The next month, Felarca took part in large Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Berkeley and Oakland and BUSD said she missed work inappropriately as a result.\nBUSD described an interview with Felarca in February 2015 where staff questioned her about her absences. The district described her as snide and evasive in response to questions, and said she had claimed to be unable to remember where she'd been on the dates in question.\n\"You continued to insist that you had no independent recollection of being at and speaking at these protests,\" the district wrote. \"This was despite the fact that you had taken two full days off work to attend, had spoken during public comment, had a large bullhorn in your hand outside and spoke to a large group of students, and passionately and loudly advocated for your cause; and despite the fact that you clearly wanted the attention and media coverage. Your continued and repeated claims, frequently accompanied by long pauses and a smirk on your face, that you could not recall being there, were patently dishonest.\"\nIn October 2015, BUSD said Felarca sought permission to take students to immigration court in San Francisco for the hearing of a woman seeking asylum. BUSD said BAMN was involved in advocacy work for the case, and that Felarca failed to disclose that in her request for the field trip.\n\"It is clear that your request to take these students to witness the asylum seeker's hearing was misleading and in clear violation of the previous directives that you had been given not to try to indoctrinate your students into your political viewpoints,\" BUSD wrote. \"This position taken by you and BAMN that U.S. border should be entirely open is a very radical and controversial idea that many students and parents would not support.\"\nYvette Felarca, with Berkeley protest organizer By Any Means Necessary, speaks with a megaphone Wednesday night. Photo: Daniel McPartlanThe district ultimately denied the field trip request but said Felarca was absent anyway, and was interviewed on TV during the event.\nThe letter went on to describe a contentious Oakland Unified School Board meeting Felarca had attended, and been arrested during -- on suspicion of creating a disturbance, refusing to leave the meeting and related issues. BUSD said she logged into the district system that night indicating she would take a sick day the following day.\nBUSD interviewed Felarca again in November 2015 to ask about her absences from work, and about her arrest as well. BUSD said Felarca was \"evasive and dishonest\" in her answers about those subjects.\n\"It is evident that the previously issued Notice of Unsatisfactory Performance and Unprofessional Conduct has been insufficient to correct the deficiencies noted therein,\" BUSD wrote. \"You were given explicit directives regarding expectations for the future, and you have repeatedly and deliberately violated those directives. You have been repeatedly and openly defiant and dishonest, and have displayed an utter lack of remorse for any of your misconduct.\"\nBUSD said it would dock Felarca's pay \"due to your failure to comply with the provisions for paid leave.\"\nTeacher says BUSD was \"trying to bully me out of the District\"\nYvette Felarca. Photo: FacebookIn her own 10-page grievance letter in response to those allegations, dated Sept. 14, 2016, Felarca requested that her 25.17 days of backpay be returned to her, writing, \"We cannot allow the District to dictate what teachers do on their own time.\"\nShe said the district's \"political witch-hunt\" would \"send a message to the Latina/o, Asian, Arab and other immigrant students and to black, Muslim and other minority students and the many anti-racist white students I reach every day, that the teachers who actively defend their rights and interests and tell the plain truth about racism and the new Jim Crow are not welcome and will be driven out of BUSD.\"\nShe wrote that the district acted against her as a result of the media coverage of the Sacramento white nationalist rally, as well as the outcry that arose against her at that time. That outcry included anonymous threats to BUSD saying King students would be harmed \"if certain actions were not taken against the teacher within the week,\" and prompted the creation of the petition to fire her because, its creator told Berkeleyside, he didn't think a \"militant agitator like Felarca\" should be allowed to \"mold impressionable students.\"\nThe Sacramento rally was not referenced at all in the district's 130-point letter, which only describes events and allegations through 2015.\nFelarca -- who has been with BUSD since 2006 -- wrote in her grievance letter that the district's notification letter about her performance was \"a classic red-baiting diatribe filled with attacks on my character and lies and demagoguery that become even more extreme as the document progresses. The District leaves no doubt that they are disciplining me and trying to bully me out of the District because they both disagree with the content of my political beliefs and political affiliations and because they reject my right to express my beliefs in my off-duty time.\"\nShe said she'd always gotten high ratings from evaluators who watched her teach, and wrote that \"Management is hoping they can circumvent our contract and concoct a case that will allow them to use the Education Code to threaten, slander, and bully me to resign.\"\nFelarca continued, \"They rely on anonymous sources, random unverified websites, or social media to attempt to discipline me and build a case for terminating me through a twisted and distorted use and understanding of the state education code,\" and said the district's attacks were simply mirroring the attacks upon her character from \"far right-wing fascists and racist organizations.\"\nShe also said some of the time she took off was for a family emergency of a very personal nature, so she had declined to share details previously. In her letter, she references documentation she says backs up the appropriateness of that leave.\nFelarca wrote that the school district referenced BAMN 21 times in its letter and \"spends a great deal of the document describing their investigations of my off duty-activities with BAMN that had no point, served no legitimate or legal end, and were nothing more than attempts to muscle me out of the District.\"\nShe writes that BUSD was also trying to discipline her for her union work as a site rep, which she said was an unfair labor practice.\nMany allies have come out to urge the district and school board to support Felarca in recent months. Image: BUSDFelarca said the district's questions about her actions at the Oakland school board meeting violated her privacy rights, and that she was never charged with a criminal offense after that meeting. She said her actions at that meeting had no relevance on Berkeley and should never have come up.\nShe wrote that the district's complaints about indoctrination had no basis, either.\n\"I have never received a single complaint from any parent claiming that their son or daughter who did not attend these field trips felt 'excluded or marginalized.' I have never received a single complaint from a single parent or student for how I present political and social issues that are under debate in our society,\" she wrote. \"I am allowed by law to express my own views on a variety of issues. In fact, I have heard from many parents and students over the course of my career teaching in Berkeley who have appreciated the fact that we address these very types of issues in my class. I have never been accused of 'indoctrinating' students or 'using them as pawns in your own personal cause.'\"\nThe parent complaint referenced in the district letter -- the allegation regarding \"marginalized Caucasian students\" -- had never been provided to Felarca in writing or been completed in a formal manner, she said, adding, \"It should have been dropped years ago.\"\nFelarca wrote, further, that the district's requirements about how she uses her leave violated her constitutional rights, and said forcing her to provide a doctor's statement for her sick days singles her out and puts a costly and cumbersome burden on her. She said, too, that limiting what she can tell her students \"is completely vague and impermissible, and it interferes with and violates my academic freedom.\"\nShe said the district presented no evidence that she ever presented one-sided views of classroom material, and slammed what she called the district's attempts to put a \"gag order\" on her \"for my attempts to build up the confidence and inclusivity of the students I teach.\"\nA fundraising campaign to help with Felarca's legal efforts raised about $3,600.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Teacher asks for help after Fox backlash; court papers show contentious history with BUSD", "Tags": "['Berkeley Federation of Teachers', 'Berkeley Unified School District', 'By Any Means Necessary', 'UC Berkeley protests', 'Yvette Felarca']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Politics', 'Schools']", "Natural Language Location": "Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.881745", "Zip Code": "94703", "ID": "248756", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.276966", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/16/berkeley-teacher-asks-help-fox-backlash-court-papers-show-contentious-history-busd/", "Author": "Emilie Raguso", "Date": "2017-02-16T16:04:11-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "In 2015, Katherine Harr, the Rent Stabilization Board commissioner who just resigned, addressed housing affordability issues at a community meeting.  Photo: Kathleen CostanzaThe Berkeley Rent Stabilization Board is seeking applications for a seat on its board, which has opened up because Commissioner Katherine Harr has resigned.\nHarr, who has been a commissioner for almost seven years, stepped down Jan. 31 citing family and health issues. She also stated in her resignation letter that she and her husband may be moving out of Berkeley.\nHarr has been a fierce advocate for tenants during her time on the board. She is closely involved with the Berkeley Tenants Union and has spent many hours documenting landlords who are illegally renting out their apartments on Airbnb and other services. She was a supporter of 2016's Measure AA, which increased the relocation fees landlords had to pay when evicting tenants, and also limited evictions during the school year for families with children. She also supported Measure U1, which raised the business license tax on landlords.\n\"She was absolutely amazing,\" said Leah Simon-Weisberg, who is also a Rent Board commissioner. \"She inspired me to run. She devoted a lot of time to the Rent Board. She was very active. She will be gravely missed.\"\n\nTraditionally, the Rent Board has been a stepping stone to higher office in Berkeley, so there will probably be many applications for the vacant seat, said Jay Kelekian, the executive director. Wesley Hester, Betty Olds, Max Anderson, and current Mayor Jesse Arreguin all went from the Rent Board to the City Council.\nThe board is accepting applications for Harr's seat through 5 p.m. on Feb. 22, said Kelekian. (Those submitted by then will be included in the agenda packet for the Rent Board; late applications will be handed out to commissioners at the Feb. 27 meeting.) Applicants must live, and vote, in Berkeley. To apply, candidates must submit a letter of 500 or fewer words detailing his/her background and why she or he wants to serve on the board.\n\"The Board wishes to set up an open and transparent selection process that considers all qualified candidates,\" John Selawsky, the Rent Board president said in a press release.\nHarr also encouraged people to apply.\n\"I have resigned for personal reasons,\" Harr wrote on Facebook. \"The Rent Board is going to appoint someone and they are taking applications until February 22. I actually knew no one when I was appointed to the Board seven years ago -- but I was qualified. I encourage all to apply and will post more info soon.\"\nOn Feb. 27, the Rent Board will gather to narrow down the number of applicants. Each commissioner will be able to nominate up to two people for the seat, said Kelekian.\nOnce a list of finalists is compiled, a subcommittee of four members of the board will vet the nominees. Kelekian said a new commissioner will be selected March 20. That person will serve until Nov. 20, 2018, and will have to run for election if he or she wants to retain the seat.\nThe last time there was a vacancy on the board (when Jack Harrison died in 2009) all the applicants were vetted and it took four months to select a new commissioner (who happened to be Harr), said Kelekian. The board thinks this will be a more efficient process.\nThe board will honor Harr at its March 20 meeting.\nIn addition to the 500-word statement about their candidacy, all applications must include the candidate's full legal name, current living address (post office boxes will not be accepted), telephone and other contact numbers. The applications may be mailed or dropped off at the Rent Board offices at 2125 Milvia St., Berkeley 94704, to the attention of Jen Fabish.

Rendering: Panoramic InterestsWhere others cities will not venture, Berkeley dares to go. That's how City Councilman Ben Bartlett views council's unanimous vote Tuesday night to move ahead and explore the possibility of building tiny housing units aimed at the homeless and those on very low incomes.\n\"We have agreed to fast-track the creation of new forms of supportive housing using new construction methods and new financing methods,\" Bartlett said the day after the vote, stressing how pleased he was that his first major council item had been so roundly supported. (Bartlett joined council representing South Berkeley's District 3 in December.)\n\"We worked together to craft a beneficial program that will benefit the community and the homeless and create a new market,\" he said. \"I am not willing to sit by and watch people die in the street.\" Bartlett was referring to the recent deaths of homeless people in Berkeley.\nBartlett's item, which was co-sponsored by Councilwomen Lori Droste and Linda Maio, recommends that the city solicit proposals to build the units, find city-owned land on which to build them, fast-track the necessary permits and allocate the money necessary to pay the monthly leases.\n\nThe template for the housing units, as well the business model underpinning them, has been provided by local developer Patrick Kennedy of Panoramic Interests, who showcased his 160-square-foot MicroPAD in downtown Berkeley last month. However, the city said it will choose a developer through a competitive bidding process.\nPhoto: David YeeRead more about Berkeley's homelessness crisis.\n\"The city calls on all innovators to come to Berkeley,\" Bartlett said. \"We are looking for parties that can rapidly and efficiently provide below-market-rate housing and supportive care.\" He added that prefab micro units of the kind made by Panoramic Interests will be considered.\nThe housing units would be privately built, operated by a nonprofit, and would cost $1,000 a month to rent. Berkeley estimates that conventionally constructed buildings cost the city an average of $429,400 per unit. With a private developer assuming the construction costs -- anywhere between $20-25 million according to Kennedy -- the city would only be responsible for making sure the rent got paid. Bartlett foresees the rent being covered partly by the tenants, using their SSI check, partly by a nonprofit, and partly by the city who provides a backstop.\nSan Francisco recently rejected Panoramic Interests' micro-unit proposal. The fact the units are made overseas, in China, and not by U.S. unionized labor, was a deal breaker. The city also said there were already too many demands being made on scarce public property.\nKennedy said that if he gets the go-ahead for Berkeley, he will use unionized labor for the on-site buildout which, he said, accounts for 66% of the project costs. He has joined forces with Berkeley architect David Trachtenberg to design the buildings locally.\nKennedy is taking his concept to other cities, including Oakland and Los Angeles. He says his goal is to provide housing for 5,000 Bay Area homeless people in the next five years.\nThe idea of small modular housing units for those without homes is finding some traction. American Family Housing, a homeless and housing nonprofit in Orange County, LA, last week unveiled an apartment building built with recycled shipping containers that will house homeless veterans.\nThe interior of a MicroPAD. Photo: Panoramic InterestsEven once it has settled on a builder, there are several hurdles to clear for Berkeley: firstly finding a site, or sites, on which to build the stackable housing units. The approved council item recommends that the city initially obtain zoning and permitting approval for a 4-story, 100-unit building to be built on public land. Kennedy himself has identified several potential sites: the former Berkeley High tennis courts, now a parking lot; the Berkeley Way parking lot downtown (parking would be preserved under the building); and the rear of the main Berkeley Post Office at 2000 Alston Way, although this is landmarked making it difficult if not impossible.\nCity staff presented a report Tuesday about the availability of public land for this purpose and every parcel described faces challenges. Staff evaluated 119 publicly owned parcels and narrowed the ones that looked promising to six, according to a staff report. Only two met all the criteria: 1) To be located within zones allowing multifamily development; 2) Larger than 15,000 square feet; 3) Not protected under Measure L, the Berkeley Public Parks and Open Space Preservation Ordinance.; and 4) Have no existing structures.\nThe two were the Berkeley Way parking lot at 2012 Berkeley Way and the Elmwood parking lot behind College Avenue stores at 2642 Russell St. But Berkeley already has a disposition and development agreement with Bridge Housing to build a homeless service center and apartments on the Berkeley Way lot. The Elmwood lot is narrow and would need rezoning. The other four lots met fewer of the criteria and also had some challenges.\nEqually tough, perhaps, will be the need to establish criteria for selecting individuals and determining eligibility.

Photo: Lance KnobelThe Berkeley Police Department has agreed to document force during demonstrations and protests in more detail, and pledged to continue to work on getting body cameras for officers, following a settlement agreement finalized Tuesday in closed session before the Berkeley City Council.\nThe National Lawyers Guild of San Francisco brought the suit in November 2015 on behalf of 11 plaintiffs who said they were victims of police brutality during a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Berkeley on Dec. 6, 2014.\n\"The plaintiffs alleged that they were clubbed and tear gassed for no reason and forcibly herded more than a mile down Telegraph Avenue, from the south campus area into Oakland,\" according to a National Lawyers Guild (NLG) statement about the settlement released Wednesday.\nOne of the plaintiffs was photojournalist Sam Wolson, who was working to document the Dec. 6, 2014, demonstration for the San Francisco Chronicle. Wolson said he was hit in the head by an officer's baton after he knelt down to take a photograph.\n\nSee an archive, created by BPD, of video footage from Dec. 6.\nThe city of Berkeley agreed to a payment of $125,000, a commitment to seek body cameras, and four policy changes related to force and enforcement during demonstrations and protests involving crowds.\nBerkeley city spokesman Matthai Chakko said that payment of $125,000 includes attorney fees and costs. Originally the lawyers were seeking $775,000, with $500,000 of that for fees, he said. (Update, Feb. 16: Rachel Lederman, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, disputed this figure and said the initial settlement bargaining position on the monetary relief was $250,000.)\nOf the 11 initial plaintiffs, only seven remained at the time of this week's agreement. Two settled in May for an undisclosed amount with the city of Hayward, which provided mutual aid at the Dec. 6 protest. And two others dismissed their own claims in July, Chakko said. (When the prospect of the lawsuit first arose, NLG said it had identified 14 claimants from Dec. 6-8, 2014.)\nThe settlement requires officers to complete written reports, as quickly as possible, following any demonstration or \"crowd event\" to detail any force that was used. They will have to describe the reason for the force, as well as its location and type, and provide information about the person on whom force was used. This wasn't the case before.\nBPD also has to change its approach to baton use on skirmish lines. According to Lederman, BPD had been following an unwritten policy that allowed officers \"to use their batons on anyone who entered their 'safety zone' -- an unmarked, undefined distance from a line of officers.\"\nCivil rights attorney Jim Chanin, co-counsel for the plaintiffs, said that now, even on the skirmish line, \"To comply with the Fourth Amendment, force must be necessary and reasonable.\"\nThe third piece of the settlement requires BPD to \"be mindful\" of the risk of impacting unintended targets when less-lethal force is used \"due to unexpected crowd movement,\" Chakko said.\nFourth, the city said it would consider \"cite and release\" -- rather than taking people to jail -- as an option during mass arrest scenarios.\nThe department also \"made a commitment to seek full implementation of police body cameras,\" according to the NLG statement.\nThe effort to seek body cameras has been in the works for quite some time, but has struggled due to lack of funding. Council previously approved a pilot program for the cameras, but never allocated the money to get it going. As part of the settlement, BPD will once again ask council to set aside that money.\nBPD has said in the past that the time spent by officers dealing with body camera footage would amount to about five full-time positions over the course of a year. But many officers have said they support the move because cameras have been shown to decrease the number of complaints faced by police departments.\nCity spokesman Chakko said Wednesday that there was no acceptance of any liability by any party named in the lawsuit. Claims against all individual defendants were dismissed as part of the settlement.\nHe said, too, that the Berkeley Police Department launched, and later completed, a comprehensive review of its own policies in the immediate aftermath of the 2014 protests, and that BPD continues to be committed to serving the community in line with Berkeley values. The department ultimately came up with 32 recommendations for ways it could improve, which it outlined in a 161-page report it made available to the public.\n\"This was something they took on themselves well before any litigation,\" Chakko said, of the policy review and subsequent work with the city's volunteer Police Review Commission to refine its approach to crowd control and crowd management.\nMoni Law, in the NLG statement, said she and the other plaintiffs \"consider the settlement a victory for a better Berkeley, one that supports our diverse, engaged and outspoken community.\"\nLaw said she was clubbed in the back from behind while she was urging other demonstrators to give police more space.\nShe said she'd like to see the city go further, however, and prohibit police from ever using \"less than lethal\" weapons and chemical agents, including tear gas, at protests.\nIn February 2015, council said police could not use tear gas on peaceful crowds, but left it available as an option should violence arise.\nThe full complaint can be read here.

Under the settlement, Berkeley agreed to drop a lawsuit it had filed to force Sarachan to pay $640,000 in liens or have the city sell the lot at auction. But little obvious progress has been made since then.\nWorthington said Sarachan's current plans do not include the affordable housing units the settlement required: 20% affordable housing plus one extra unit. If he doesn't build those units, under the settlement terms, Worthington said Sarachan is required to pay the city what he owes.\n\n\"Complaints of rats, trash, and noise have continued ... with business owners especially affected by the lot's lack of aesthetic appeal and sanitation,\" writes Worthington in his Feb. 14 agenda item. \"With the construction of the Sequoia building and the Cody's Books building ... in progress, it is urgent to get immediate results on this lot.\"\nHe continues: \"Immediate action to require the owner to begin development of the affordable housing units and public restroom would be of the utmost importance. The Owner should be required to deliver an executed agreement with a purchaser committed to developing the Property or begin construction of the structure themselves within the 90 Day Deadline.\"\nWorthington may have time on his side, to some extent, but 90 days could also be a tough sell depending on contractor schedules and final design review requirements from the city. Thursday night, the city's Zoning Adjustments Board did vote unanimously in favor of Sarachan's new plans for the project, which is called El Jardin.\nArchitectural drawing of El Jardin, 2501 Haste St. Image: Jarvis ArchitectsAccording to city documents, Sarachan plans to demolish the 6,950-square-foot retail building at 2433 Telegraph, then construct a new 6-story, 111,726-square-foot mixed-use building with \"group living accommodations\" for 238 people in 161 bedrooms. There's no off-street parking.\nIncluded in the plans are 22,465 square feet of retail in the basement and ground floor.\nWhen the project last came before the zoning board in 2014, the proposal was for 79 dwelling units. In 2015, Sarachan and UC Berkeley were working on a deal to allow the building to be used for student housing. But that deal later fell through.\nAccording to the staff report for Thursday night's zoning board meeting, \"Each residential level is arranged around the courtyard at the podium level, with a mix of four-bedroom Living Accommodations, two-bedroom Living Accommodations and studios. The fourth and fifth floors also provide access to outdoor terraces at the corner of Haste and Telegraph. A larger roof deck above the sixth floor would provide the bulk of the usable open space.\"\nThe increased density, staff wrote, would be in line with the surrounding neighborhood.\nTwo rooms devoted to bike storage \"will provide enough bike parking for every resident in the building,\" according to the staff report. Staff also wrote that nearly 500 mailers went out to nearby neighbors of the project and no one sent in feedback to the city in response.\nSarachan has said in the past that his Moorish palace-like structure was inspired by Italian hill towns, Tibetan forts and the rock-cut architecture of Petra in Jordan.\nThe zoning board had staff craft additional conditions of approval before signing off on the project, including a full-time manager on site and management offices in the lobby; a safety plan, with 24-hour staffing for the front desk, to be approved by the Berkeley Police Department; and ADA compliance in line with the building code, which was of particular concern in the bathrooms.\nThe conditions of approval must also reference the settlement between Sarachan and the city, which requires a public restroom and affordable housing requirements, commissioners said.\nThe board said the plan still needs final approval from the Design Review Committee, which will take a close look, in particular, at the stone materials proposed for the ground floor level. Some commissioners said they were not pleased about the lack of detail in the plans and did not think it was ready for a vote, but the longstanding delays for the vacant lot were also a subject of concern.\nThe lot at 2501 Haste St. was the home to the Berkeley Inn for decades. It burned down in the 1980s and Sarachan -- who also owns Rasputin Records, Blondie's Pizza, the old Cody's Building diagonally across from the site, as well as the retail development at 2350 Telegraph -- bought the property in 1994. There were a number of existing liens on the site, and Berkeley agreed to forgo them if Sarachan developed the plot, setting an initial deadline of 2004. Sarachan acquired adjacent properties to the east and north of the site in order to build an ambitious project.\nNothing happened for years. The lot sat vacant and was infested with rats. The City Council voted in September 2011 to foreclose on the property, which would have meant Sarachan had to pay off $640,000 in liens, or see the property sold at auction.\n[Editor's note: This story was updated shortly after publication to include further detail about the affordable units Councilman Kriss Worthington said are required under the settlement agreement.

Image: Fox NewsYvette Felarca, the Berkeley Unified middle-school teacher who is also a leader of the group By Any Means Necessary, appeared on Fox News on Monday to reiterate her stance that violent protesters were justified in shutting down a speech scheduled to be delivered by right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos at UC Berkeley on Feb.1. Felarca's remarks have sparked an outcry from people who disagree with her views.\nThe phones, voicemail machines and email inboxes at the Berkeley Unified School District have been flooded with calls about Felarca, said Charles Burress, spokesman for the district. The main office of Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, where Felarca teaches, has been swamped as well. (Berkeleyside has also gotten many emails, tweets and comments on the matter.)\n\"Every (message) I've seen has been opposed to having her employed by us,\" said Burress.\nRead full Berkeleyside coverage of the Milo Yiannopoulos protest and its aftermath.A petition calling for her removal from BUSD garnered 2,000 signatures overnight, almost four times as many as had been collected in the last six months. (That number had gone over 4,000 by Wednesday.) A former King student set up the online petition at Change.org in July after he saw a video of Felarca yelling at a neo-Nazi at a Sacramento rally. On the video, Felarca is seen punching the man several times in the stomach, yelling \"Get the fuck off our streets,\" and then pulling his backpack. Felarca was later injured in the melee.\n\nThe Berkeley Unified School District wrote Felarca a warning letter a few days after the rally and placed her on paid administrative leave in September \"pending an investigation into concerns that have been raised,\" Burress said at the time. She returned to her classroom six weeks later and is still teaching. BUSD never explained its actions, citing confidentiality where personnel matters are concerned.\nHowever, a grievance, as well as a federal lawsuit filed by Felarca against the district, suggests the disciplinary action was in reaction to Felarca's political activity. In August, the district went into Felarca's bank account and withdrew the equivalent of 25.17 days of pay, according to the lawsuit. The district had retroactively un-approved a number of sick and personal days Felarca had taken \"claiming that employees could not use their personal leave days to attend political protests and claiming that Felarca had used them for this purpose,\" according to the lawsuit. Felarca has stated she had doctor's notes for some of the sick days she was absent and that she has the right to attend political rallies.\nThe next hearing for Felarca's lawsuit against BUSD is on March 2. Former students of Felarca's who were questioned by BUSD representatives also filed a case against the district. That hearing is set for March 25.\nAround 9:45 p.m. on Feb 1, Yvette Felarca debriefed people from her BAMN group, telling them that they had accomplished something significant that night. The group is on Bancroft Avenue. Felarca's back is facing the camera. She is the shortest one. Photo: Frances DinkelspielFelarca was at the Feb. 1 rally where a group of about 150 black-clad protesters removed metal barricades, threw rocks and incendiary devices at UC police, smashed windows at the MLK Student Union building, and later rampaged downtown, breaking bank windows and setting ATM machines on fire. Yet she has never stated directly that she and other members of BAMN were part of the violence.\nDespite glossing over the specifics of her action, Felarca has taken credit for \"shutting down\" Yiannopolous.\nRead more about Yvette Felarca on Berkeleyside.\"He should not be able to speak in public to spread his racist, misogynistic and homophobic lies,\" Felarca told Tucker Carlson on Fox News.\nFelarca could not be reached for comment Tuesday.\nFelarca has become the face of the radical opposition since the majority of the violent \"black-bloc\" protesters covered their faces with ski masks and bandanas and have not spoken out since Feb. 1, despite widespread criticism of their tactics. But Felarca has been more than eager to talk. Berkeleyside interviewed her during the protests. Her interviews with KTVU and now Fox News have been watched thousands of times.\nFelarca's remarks prompted an outpouring of outrage on Twitter and on the YouTube channel featuring the interview, as well as directed to the school district. Critics have tweeted \"Let's riot at her house,\" and then published her home address. (An incorrect address, by the way.) They have listed the phone number for BUSD. They have written that Felarca should be waterboarded and arrested.\n\"I can not believe this racist is allowed to teach our children!\" a Houston man named Brad McPherson wrote to Berkeleyside. \"What is wrong with you people???\"\nOther comments were infused with swear words and derogatory remarks.\nThe school district issued a statement Wednesday from Ty Alper, the board president. He said the district could not respond to questions about whether Felarca would be reprimanded for her actions because it is a personnel matter. BUSD believes in the right of free speech, said Alper.\n\"It is important to emphasize that we firmly support the First Amendment right to free speech,\" Alper said in the statement. \"We also strongly condemn the use of violence in confronting speech, even speech we might find abhorrent or counter to the values of our community.\"\nEditors' note: This article was updated 2/15 at 3 p.m. to add the comments from the school district. \n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Rage against Yvette Felarca mounts after Fox News interview", "Tags": "['Berkeley Unified School District', 'By Any Means Necessary', 'UC Berkeley protests', 'Yvette Felarca']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Schools', 'UC Berkeley']", "Natural Language Location": "Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.881745", "Zip Code": "94703", "ID": "248409", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.276966", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/14/rage-yvette-felarca-mounts-fox-news-interview/", "Author": "Frances Dinkelspiel", "Date": "2017-02-14T14:01:10-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "As the recently retired Alameda County Superintendent of Schools and a Berkeley resident, I am supporting Kate Harrison for City Council District 4.\nKate looks like the girl next door but make no mistake: Kate is a heavyweight.

Photo: Lutzker family\nLater this month, the Berkeley City Council will consider an update to the city's bicycle plan, which hasn't been updated since 2005. The new plan was developed through a two-year process involving city staff, outside technical experts, and significant public input. It's focused on improving conditions for people who bike or want to bike (collectively, 90% of Berkeley residents, according to a recent survey), but it also supports the city's broader health and environmental goals, and reflects the common sense idea that streets are for everyone - bicyclists, pedestrians and drivers alike.\nIt is a good plan and should be approved.\nWe are Berkeley residents and parents of two young kids. Like many others in Berkeley, we rely on biking as our primary form of transportation. We choose biking over car trips whenever possible because we like the freedom and physical exercise, because it saves us money, and because it's our small way of reducing congestion, pollution and greenhouse gases. When we're with our kids, we pull them on a long-tail bike or trailer or, increasingly, they ride independently.\nGetting around the city by bike, especially with kids, is possible only because the city took innovative steps in the 1970s to develop a bicycle plan and build bicycle-specific infrastructure. Berkeley's network of bicycle boulevards, with its various treatments to slow and discourage car traffic, is the product of this early investment. Most of our trips, and essentially all of our trips where our kids ride independently, are on the bicycle boulevard network.\nLeConte Elementary School bike train riding on Russell Street. Photo: Bobby Lutzker\nBut the existing infrastructure is now outdated and does not meet the needs of Berkeley's bicycling community, especially families. There is no safe way for young kids to ride through downtown or to the UC campus area. (Riding in that area last year, our friend Meg Schwarzman was nearly killed.\nOutside of downtown, the bicycle boulevard network is not dense enough to reach key destinations. Only half of Berkeley's public schools are within a block of a bicycle boulevard, forcing kids onto high-stress streets to reach school by bike. In addition, at intersections like Russell and Shattuck or Virginia and San Pablo, bicycle boulevards meet busy streets with no crossing assistance. At these intersections, bicyclists have to either wait indefinitely for a break in traffic or enter dangerously and hope that cars will stop. We know a lot of families that would like to start riding, or to ride more, but just don't feel safe enough on the city's streets.\nThe new bicycle plan would address these issues by expanding the bicycle boulevard network to include 8 new bicycle boulevards, adding crossing assistance where bicycle boulevards meet busy streets, and, most importantly, establishing a network of protected bike lanes through downtown and the UC campus area.\nProtected bike lanes, which physically separate car traffic from bicycles by a lane of parked cars, pylons, or other barriers, are by far the best way to create a safe route for all riders through a congested area. (The new protected bike lane on Fulton Street, which was created in response to our friend Meg's collision there, likely would have prevented that near-fatal collision.) The new bicycle plan calls for a two-way protected bike lane on Milvia Street, from Blake Street to Hearst Avenue. This would allow our kids, and riders of many other ages and abilities, to safely reach downtown destinations or ride through downtown to other parts of the city.\nThe new plan's proposed low-stress bikeway network, with flags showing location of BUSD schools.\nTo be sure, the new bicycle plan is not perfect. We would have wanted it to include an even denser low-stress network, greater protections at busy street crossings, and other things like specified paving-quality standards for all bikeways. Nor do we have any illusions that protected bike lanes will eliminate every possible hazard. But none of that changes the fact that the new plan will make it safer and easier to get around the city by bike, shifting our mix of transportation choices in a healthier direction.

The cities of San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose, longtime beacons of upward mobility [2], are now examples of how painfully high rent can damage local communities and even the national economy [3]. How did this happen in the most progressive metropolitan area in the country?\nMake no mistake: our current situation is the result of failed local policies, and today you can help to change them.\nSince the fall of 2015, I have served as the chair of the Graduate Assembly's working group tasked with helping students cope with this housing crisis. My team spent considerable time researching and developing resources to help students in need, and last summer I co-authored an internal campus report on the causes and consequences of student housing insecurity. Through conversations with local activists, readings on urban policy and economics, and meetings with campus and city representatives, I have learned that what Berkeley needs is not more platitudes but real policy changes to reverse a crippling, historic housing shortage.\nI have endorsed Ben Gould for City Council District 4 because Ben understands that high rent is fundamentally a problem of economics that must be solved by researched-backed policies. This is why he has also been endorsed by Karen Chapple, U.C. Berkeley Professor of City Planning and lead researcher of the renowned Urban Displacement Project.\nFor too long, wealthy homeowners throughout the Bay Area, from Palo Alto to the Berkeley Hills, have opposed the tall, dense apartment buildings that are needed to sustain growing cities. They have done this all under the guise of progressivism, but with justifications such as \"preservation\" and \"existing neighborhood character.\" There is nothing progressive about forcing lower income residents to compete against wealthy newcomers for housing just because you want to stop your neighborhood from changing. (The word for opposing change is not \"progressivism\" but \"conservatism\"). Both theory and empirical data [5] have shown restrictions on development to be ill-fated, particularly for low-income renters, and that to prevent increases in rent, cities should build enough housing to meet demand on a regional scale.\nSome politicians promise that opposing development will hurt no one; they promise that building some subsidized housing will do enough to support those in need. In reality, while subsidized housing does provide vital help to some of our poorest neighbors, there is no evidence that it changes demand for the remainder of the housing supply [6], and as a result, the rest of us continue to struggle under burgeoning prices. Those left out include the vast majority of Cal undergraduates, who do not qualify for federal and state subsidized housing.\nExtra efforts to protect Berkeley's most vulnerable residents should still be an urgent moral priority, and Ben has a detailed plan to preserve and expand our affordable housing supply. But housing policy needs to create affordability for everyone, not just a lucky few. To see how the candidates compare, I matched their platforms against the policies to increase housing affordability proposed by SPUR [7] and the Urban Displacement Project [8].\n\nBen's platform is the most comprehensive. Crucially, his opponent's platform makes no mention of supporting increased housing production for middle and upper-income residents, although that is precisely what is needed to make Berkeley affordable for the teachers, artists, service workers, students, and researchers who make Berkeley great. Fixing our housing shortage will not just happen on its own; it requires sustained, regional initiatives. Simply put: if you are not actively addressing our housing shortage, you are worsening it.\nBen's policy acumen, intelligence, and earnestness have earned him the endorsements of State Senator Nancy Skinner, Councilmembers Lori Droste and Susan Wengraf, former Councilmembers Darryl Moore and Gordon Wozniak, and numerous other elected officials and local leaders who see him fit to serve the interests for all District 4 residents. Every single executive officer in the ASUC and GA has endorsed Ben for City Council (except for the Student Advocate, who does not endorse)*, demonstrating both the respect he has among student leaders and that he knows students' housing needs best.\nMost importantly to me, Ben Gould embodies the call to action that President Obama made after last November's election. We need new local leadership, not just to challenge the failed dogmas of local politics but also to build up the future leaders of our state and federal government. Today, you have the opportunity to support an honest, motivated leader who will produce progressive outcomes for Berkeley.\nVote Ben Gould for Berkeley City Council District 4. Mail-in ballots are due March 7. More information can be found at Ben Gould for City Council.\n*Titles are for identification purposes only and do not express an opinion of the ASUC or GA.

Instead, 4,000 to 5,000 students* and others protested the event, shutting it down. From the perspective of what is good for humanity, this was the right thing to do.\nSince then, Donald Trump has threatened to defund UC Berkeley. Berkeley Mayor Arreguin made a statement against Milo and was hit with an avalanche of death threats. And nearly every major media outlet has distorted or decried this protest. These and other attacks are outrageous and should be opposed.\nTo be clear, the real question here is not \"free speech\" or not. The heart of the matter is that the Trump administration is a fascist regime now in power, and Milo Yiannopoulos is a high-level operative of that regime, actively working on the Nazification of the American University.\nFirst off, Milo is not just expressing opinions at these events, and he's certainly not challenging some stifling political expectations as he claims. Frankly, a good portion of what he does is insult people's appearance and intelligence, marginalized people in particular. His history is also rife with instances where he targeted people, and encouraging others to harass, stalk, and threaten.\nMost importantly, Milo is an actual fascist operative working on the fascist Trump-Pence agenda. He is a senior editor for the extreme right-wing rag Breitbart, run until recently by Steve Bannon. Steve Bannon now holds a special position on the National Security Council! At the University of New Mexico, at the culmination of his event, Yiannopoulos posted the ICE phone number and called on the audience to write it down and \"Purge Your Local Illegals;\" he told them to call the number \"if you suspect\" someone to be an \"illegal alien.\" Teaming up with David Horowitz - who has a long record of targeting, blacklisting, and aiming to get fired radical-minded professors - Milo Yiannopoulos is explicitly working to end sanctuary campuses nationwide.\nTrump and his gang of criminals threaten the press, declare the court system illegitimate if they oppose him, and threaten or fire entire staffs of people for speaking out against him. That is the regime that Milo Yiannopoulos is working for and constantly praising. Milo's tour is part of this: a whole fascist assault on critical thinking and dissent, that is coming down at breakneck speed. Fascism is about hiding or denying the facts and crushing the opposition, because carrying out a fascist program goes against facts, and what most people think is good for the world. This is how they prepare their supporters to do their terrible deeds.\nFrom the perspective of the fascist, universities are a real problem spot, since they mainly encourage critical thinking, research, and the exploration of different views. That's why Yiannopoulos & Horowitz are focusing on the campuses, and why Trump wholeheartedly supports their campaign.\nAll this is why the protest at UC Berkeley was exactly the kind of mass resistance that needs to happen everywhere, on an unprecedented scale, to actually drive out the Trump-Pence regime. If you care about critical thinking, the right to dissent, and the pursuit of knowledge, science, or truth - you should defend & support this much-needed protest. If you stand on the side of humanity and the planet, you should stand on the side of all those who shut down Milo Yiannopoulos at Cal.\n(Editor's note: The UC police department estimated there were 1,500 protesters, not 4,000 to 5,000.)\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Op-ed: Shutting down Milo Yiannopoulos was the right thing to do", "Tags": "['Berkeley protests', 'Donald Trump', 'UC Berkeley', 'UC Berkeley protests']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Opinion', 'Politics']", "Natural Language Location": "UC Berkeley", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.869861", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "248237", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.258765", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/13/op-ed-shutting-milo-yiannopoulos-right-thing/", "Author": "Guest contributor", "Date": "2017-02-13T10:30:34-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "A graphic on the web page of \"Wall of Us,\" which sends out four \"resistance\" suggestions each week.Ever since the election, dozens of protest websites have sprung up, each one focusing on a different way of resisting the Trump administration. There are so many suggestions of useful things to do that one can easily become overwhelmed with all the choices and end up doing ... exactly nothing.\nEnter Wall of Us, a somewhat whimsical activist website created by two Berkeley friends that attempts to cut through the clutter. The site's mission is \"to make it simply irresistible for Americans to become active participants in rebuilding our democracy.\" To achieve this goal, every Sunday the site posts and sends out four (and only four) suggested actions for the coming week.\n\"We research the most timely things occurring on a national and local basis at the moment, and focus on those,\" said Kara Ganter, one of the site's co-founders. Of course, with the chaos emanating from Washington on a daily basis, selecting just four things is not easy. But Ganter and her co-founder, Amelia Miazad, consult with a group of leaders who host other action-related websites and attempt to collaborate and consolidate efforts. \"We have talked to the IndivisibleGuide.com guys about how we can support each other, and we talk to flippable.org and SwingLeft.org and lots of others\" on regular conference calls, Ganter said.\n(Another site to check out is one put together by the organizers of the Women's March: Hear Our Voice: 10 Actions in the first 100 days.)\n\nFor the week of Feb. 13, the site's suggested actions included sending some love to Senator Elizabeth Warren who was silenced last week \"by Senate Republicans who invoked a rarely-used senate rule to prevent her from reading a letter written by Dr. King's widow criticizing Jeff Sessions;\" to keep calling Congressional representatives to demand an ethics investigation into \"national security advisor Michael Flynn's sloppy and shady dealings with Russia, among other demands;\" to boycott Trump; and make a plan to visit your members of Congress in February.\n\"He promised a wall,\" the site's home page reads, \"he will be stopped by a wall of us.\" Unlike many of the other sites -- which are often some variation of red, white and blue (or just white and blue) -- Wall of Us presents visitors with a riot of colors. It is a very visually stimulating site because, Ganter wrote, \"even a website about resisting ugly policies should be pretty.\"\nWall of Us co-founders Amelia Miazad and Kara Ganter. Photo: Wall of UsGanter has journalism and law degrees from the University of Wisconsin and she's trained in instructional design, educational technology, and pedagogy. So it's not surprising that she is also well versed in the demographics of her audience. \"The major followers of social media are women,\" she said. \"80 percent of Facebook and Twitter users are women, so if we analyze our subscribers we would find a similar distribution.\"\n\"I feel like we are providing a voice to a group of people in this country who were gutted by this election:  it was and is traumatic,\" she said. \"We wanted to create a voice and an avenue that is particularly appealing to women.\" The goal was to \"make activism look nice. It's a place where we can express our humanity: the last thing we need  is an ugly website!\"\nWhile Ganter is deadly serious about her mission, she also has a sense of humor that is refreshing in these dark times. Her on-line bio says that she grew up in rural Wisconsin, \"where it is not polite to talk about politics and the most appropriate way to deal with feelings is crying in the shower.\" When that stopped working for her post-election, \"she decided an alternate coping strategy was necessary.\"\nThis coping strategy ultimately became Wall of Us, which she created along with her friend and fellow UC Berkeley School of Law staffer Miazad. According to her on-line bio, Miazad \"is an Afghan-born American girl (no birth certificate folks, you'll just have to trust her) who became even more true-blue after the November 8th election. In addition to practicing law, Amelia has founded non-profits and led higher educational programs, initiatives, and social enterprises.\"\nSo in addition to their full-time jobs, the two friends now work almost full-time on Wall of Us.  The site was originally launched in late November of 2016 to a small social media following as well as family and friends. It grew to 15,000 subscribers within a week and now has over 50,000 subscribers. \"We were not prepared for that:  it was a shock, but also an amazing feeling,\" Ganter said. \"We were just hoping we'd send out an email to a couple of hundred friends and family, and that was it.\"\nGanter and Miazad work to amplify the work of other resistance websites, although they personally \"curate\" the specific actions recommended every week. \"Not everyone has time to show up at their Senator's office every day, or spend a ton of time being an activist,\" Ganter said. She hopes that the site will double as an instructional tool, \"educating the next generation of Americans about the political process, and helping them get involved.\"\nGanter notes that many people in the 18-25 age group have not been engaged in politics, and didn't pay much attention before the election. \"We really need to reach out to that demographic,\" she says. \"In order for our democracy to thrive, we need to get through to them somehow. We need to have an app, make it fun, have little videos.  Democratic activism hasn't done that before, but we need to interact in a new way.\"\nIn addition, Ganter and Miazad want to work with other Berkeley experts in the future to teach people about law and activism -- \"polite activism\" -- and how to run for office. \"If you don't like what's happening, get involved,\" Ganter said.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Can resisting Trump be fun?

Four staff members, all young people who are paid a stipend for their on-the-job training, have been put on hiatus.\n\nDown Bolivar Drive, other businesses are suffering, too.

Photo: Jeanine NicholsonWaterside Workshops at Aquatic parkThe problem is, in part, the seemingly unending parade of storms that have pummeled the Bay Area since the early part of 2017. In January, the city saw 10.88 inches of rain, according to the hydrology site Balance Hydrologies. Since October, the city has gotten 26.09 inches of rain. Much of Berkeley drains westward, and the storm runoff is dumped into Aquatic Park on its way to San Francisco Bay.\nBut the real culprit is the antiquated drainage system that is failing, and failing hard.\nWhen the state built the Bayside Freeway in the 1930s, the 102-acre Aquatic Park was created from intertidal and subtidal areas, according to a report prepared for the city in 2008. Culverts connect the three lagoons in the park - the Main Lagoon, the Model Yacht Basin and the Radio Tower pond - to San Francisco Bay.\nThe five main tide tubes that drain water from the park into the bay go under I-80 and are falling apart on the bay side, according to the report, prepared by Laurel Marcus and Associates/Hydrologic Systems. One tube is buried in some sand. Another is cracked and another has collapsed upon itself. The disrepair means water does not drain adequately from Aquatic Park, particularly when heavy rainfall and runoff swamp the system.\nBroken tidal tubes by Aquatic Park. Photo: Citizen reporterThe poor drainage also leads to high water temperatures and low oxygen levels in the summer, which can be fatal to fish.\nIt's a problem without an immediate solution.\n\"The tidal tubes do need to be replaced,\" said Matthai Chakko, a city spokesman. \"This has been something we have been concerned about for some time.\"\nLearn more about Berkeley infrastructure bonds Measure M and Measure T1.The problem, of course, is money.\nEven though Berkeley has passed a number of bond infrastructure measures  - the most recent one was Measure T1, a $100 million bond measure approved in November - very little money has been spent to repair the tide tubes. Staff recommended to City Council in January that the city allocate $250,000 of the Measure T1 money to analyze the best way to repair or replace the tubes, get the necessary permits, and prepare architectural documents.\nBut there still isn't any money budgeted to do the actual repairs. Berkeley has a long list of unfunded infrastructure needs, as much as $100 million for parks alone. Many projects are not even in line for funds, including the Berkeley Pier, which was shuttered in July 2015 because of structural issues.\nThe city of Berkeley has been helping Waterside Workshops cope with the flooding, which has left the buildings as \"little islands,\" said Rich. The rains and the tides have washed tons of garbage and debris onto the property and city staff has been helping clean it up, she said. She is grateful for that assistance.\nBut Rich wants the city to declare some sort of emergency decree to get more funding to the area, and much faster. City officials are planning to solicit more public comment on how to allocate Measure T1 money and Rich intends to make sure they know how dire the situation at Aquatic Park is.\nFlooding at Waterside Workshops in Aquatic Park.

No, I am not looking for a place but, nonetheless, I do witness the effects of this crisis as the nurses at local clinics, the firefighters in BFD, and my teachers at BHS cannot afford to live in Berkeley. \nMichigan Superintendent Brian J. Whiston recently said that he wished that all full-time public-school teachers could be paid in six figures, but that it is not feasible under current economic conditions. I don't know whether it is feasible or not, but I do know that it is completely possible to enable our teachers, nurses, firefighters, and other valuable community members to live where they work: here, in Berkeley.\nEveryone on City Council agrees that there is an affordable housing crisis in Berkeley. However, they disagree on how to address it. One leading position is to push for dramatic increases in development of new housing so that supply in housing markets increase to meet current demands. To aid this cause, the city would have to speed up the process of approving new construction. Other politicians in Berkeley present a different approach. These politicians believe in the need for \"community-, not developer-driven, development.\" \nHowever, unfortunately this seemingly progressive concept of community-driven development would, in practice, mean no development at all. This is because the \"community\" includes a lot of homeowners for whom new construction would not be favorable. Furthermore, the middle-income people who work in Berkeley but are forced to live elsewhere are not considered part of the \"community.\" The other leading group that would support more affordable housing in Berkeley would be UC Berkeley students. However, many of these students are not registered to vote in Berkeley.\nSupporters of \"community-, not developer-driven, development\" often claim that deregulation, or even preventing further regulation, of new construction might adversely impact the environment. This is why we need knowledgeable people like Ben Gould  -- who is running for City Council representing District 4 -- involved in the processes of regulation and deregulation. \nGould has done research at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory about the ways in which certain human actions influence air quality. He is also completing a dual graduate degree at UC Berkeley in Environmental Engineering and Public Policy. Gould is very passionate about applying the solutions to our environmental problems to policies, and he has shown this with his work when he chaired the Community Environmental Advisory Commission. \nGould asserts that many of the regulations deliver no benefit to environmental sustainability. According to Gould, these regulations do nothing more than hinder new construction, making them effectively anti-housing regulations rather than pro-sustainability. Moreover, housing is necessary for a sustainable community. Therefore, these anti-housing regulations are also anti-sustainability. Gould will make sure that there are \"strong green standards for new buildings\" without letting green-washed anti-housing policies fly.\nAnother argument for community-driven development is that it is the only way to ensure that development happens in such a way that these displaced middle-income workers can afford them. The truth is, if city councilmembers remain committed to the cause of affordable housing, then they will not let development that does not benefit these people fly. This is exactly what Ben Gould will do in City Council, and this is precisely what he has done while serving on the Housing Advisory Commission.\nGould will \"fight to make sure that all new housing is contributing to greater affordability.\" And, knowing that there can be no meaningful compromise when it comes to social justice, Gould pledges to \"build high-quality housing for people at all income levels.\" \nBen Gould will make sure that Berkeley sets itself on a course to becoming a truly inclusive community. As Berkeley resident and Daily Kos founder Markos Moulitsas recently put it in the Berkeleyside comments: \"More housing to meet demand, thus slowing or reversing the increase in housing prices?... Finally someone who understands basic economics....Vote for Gould!

Photo: Isabelle Gaston\nDespite an infusion of tens of millions of dollars over the last several years, Berkeley roads have continued to deteriorate. And the way the City has used the money - most of it from Measure M, a bond measure passed in 2012 - portends poorly for the $100 million infrastructure bond measure, Measure T1, voters adopted in November.\nBackground: Measure M\nIn 2011, Ann Marie Hogan, the city auditor, gave a report to the City Council on the City's failing streets.  In the report she wrote, \"If we can't afford to fix our streets now, how are we going to be able to afford to fix them in the future when the cost will be millions more?\"\nHogan described the City's streets as \"at risk\" with a Pavement Condition Index (PCI) of 58. The PCI is a widely-used metric to assess pavement condition. Its scale is from 0-100. A score from 0-24 is considered \"Failed;\" 25-49 \"Poor;\" 50-59 \"At Risk;\" 60- 69 \"Fair;\" 70-79 \"Good;\" and 80-100 \"Very Good/Excellent.\"\nThe auditor noted that more than 62% of Berkeley's streets needed to be resurfaced/reconstructed at an estimated cost of $54 million. She offered several recommendations to improve the PCI, including a bond measure.\nOne year later, in November 2012, Berkeley voters approved a $30 million bond measure (Measure M) to improve the condition of City streets and install green infrastructure.\nWith the infusion of $30 million, the city manager set the desired PCI of streets to be 66 to 70 by the end of the five-year Measure M implementation period. It was acknowledged that achieving a PCI of 75 (\"good\") was not possible because $7.5 million of the $30 million would be spent on green infrastructure.\nIn October 2015, the Manager of Engineering, Sean Rose, gave a positive mid-program (2.5 years) update to the City Council on Measure M. He stated that \"we started out with 58 and are now 65.\" (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1:\nSource: City of Berkeley\nThis struck me as odd because Mr. Rose's words conflicted with the data on the slide which showed a PCI of 62 (not 65) in 2015. He went on to say, \"This is the positive trend we would certainly expect to see with the expenditure of Measure M funding\" and \"It may not on its face seem like a significant increase, but it really is.\"\nEight months later, in June 2016, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) published the PCI for each city in the Bay Area for the year 2015. The overall PCI for Bay Area streets was 66. For Berkeley, it was 58.\nBecause of the discrepancy (58 vs 65), I emailed Mr. Rose for clarification. Unfortunately, he had left the City of Berkeley for a new position with the City of Woodside. I then contacted the new supervising engineer, Tracy Clay. She told me the PCI was 57 for 2015, consistent with the MTC.\nSo, after almost four years - and a tripling of money available per year for street improvements - what is the PCI of Berkeley's roads now?\nI contacted the Public Works Department in January and they said that as of the end of 2016, the PCI remains at 57 (Figure 2). In other words, despite tens of millions of dollars of new spending, the roads have deteriorated since the auditor's report in 2011.\nHoping for an explanation, I contacted the City Auditor regarding the decreased PCI but she had no comment.  I also contacted Phil Harrington, the Director of Public Works, but he has yet to respond to my inquiry.\nFigure 2:\nSource for Actual PCI: Public Works Department emails (June 2016 and January 2017)\nMr. Rose had also stated in his presentation that by spending $30 million on roads now that the City would avoid an extra $15 million in repair costs. I am not an engineer but this strikes me as dubious given the PCI has declined since the inception of Measure M and a report in late 2016 had the City's unfunded paving needs as $120 million.\nUnfinished Measure M Projects now funded under Measure T1 - Where did the Money Go?\nWhat is the purpose of this 0p-ed besides stating that Measure M has not, thus far, lived up to its campaign promises of improving our roads?\nFirst, to inform residents that there are many Measure M projects (roads and green infrastructure) that were approved by the City Council but will not be completed as planned under Measure M. Rather, these projects will now either be designed or completed with Measure T1 revenue.\nSecond, to alert residents that Measure T1 may suffer the same disappointing results as Measure M unless strict financial accounting measures, far better management, and well-defined measurable objectives and timelines are put in place - now.\nThere have already been a number of staff meetings (starting several months before the election) to decide what projects to pursue with Phase 1 of the T1 bond proceeds ($32 million). There have also been several poorly advertised commission meetings.\nFrom my perspective, Measure T1 is off to a poor start.\nStaff's recommendations (from its T1 Project Team) as put forth in the City Manager's Dec.r 22nd memo do not adequately reflect the community's wishes and needs. Staff prepared this memo without any input from the commissions or the public. Therefore, the Dec. 22nd memo should be rejected outright as a \"starting point\" because it did not follow the process that citizens were assured Measure T1 would follow.\nStreets\n\nStaff has proposed to spend $5 million on paving three miles of streets and repairing adjacent infrastructure in Phase 1.\nWith the exception of five blocks of paving of Ward Street, the streets that Staff are proposing for Measure T1 for 2018 to 2021 were originally planned to be paved with Measure M funds in 2016 and 2017 (Table 1). University was also to be paved under Measure M but now it will only be \"designed\" with Measure T1 (see footnote below).\nBecause Phase 1 occurs over a span of three years (2018 to 2021), this will result in only one mile of paving per year with T1 revenue.  This would neither increase the PCI nor improve the drivability/bike-ability of our roads (the City has >200 miles of streets).\n\n\nNote: The only sidewalks to be repaired in Phase 1 will be those along the streets listed above.* This 0.3 miles of paving of University was supposed to be completed with Measure M money at a cost of $1.3 million dollars in FY2018. It is now on the list of \"design only\" Measure T1 projects at a cost of $0.5 million. An actual completion date is not specified but a conservative estimate is at least five years from now (Phase 2, starting 2022). How the $1.3 million of Measure M money was spent, if not on University, is not clear from available documents.\nGreen Infrastructure\n\nSix out of the seven green infrastructure projects that were planned to be completed with Measure M funding in 2017 and 2018 (and that Council approved on 10/27/2015) are now going to be funded with $1 million of Measure T1 revenue in years 2018 to 2021..\nOf these six projects, only two will actually be completed with T1 revenue; four will be \"designed\" by the end of 2021 (not completed). If these four could have been completed with Measure M funding, why can't they be completed now with T1 funding?\n\n\nSources:\nOct. 10, 2015, special City Council meeting\nPublic Works CommissionSummary\n\nDespite a commendable public outreach process driven by the Public Works Commission for Measure M, Berkeley's streets have not improved since the five-year $30 million bond was approved in 2012; as of the end of 2016, the PCI, an objective measurement of pavement condition, has declined. It is unclear why, and neither the City Auditor nor Director of Public Works would care to comment.\nSix out of the seven green infrastructure projects that were to be completed in 2017 and 2018 with Measure M funding are now on the Measure T1 list. However, only two of these six projects are slated to be completed by 2021; the rest will be \"designed,\" resulting in a delay of at least five years (assuming they are completed in Phase 2, 2022).\nOver $6 million worth of projects (streets and green infrastructure) that were planned to be completed with Measure M (and were approved by Council) are now on the Measure T1 list (Tables 1 and 2). Whether other streets or green infrastructure projects were completed in lieu of the ones previously planned with Measure M funding is unverifiable with available public documents.\nCity residents have repeatedly voted for taxes to improve our streets and green infrastructure. Six separate taxes are collected by the City to pave our streets: Measure M; Measure T1; Measure B; Measure BB (which recently added $1.3 million/year to the paving budget); property tax (general fund); and gas tax. Discussions at recent Commissions' meetings indicate that City Staff are planning another bond measure for 2018; in other words, a seventh tax to pave our streets.\n\nBerkeley residents must demand stricter financial accountability before Measure T1 suffers the same fate as Measure M. At a recent City Council meeting, the Mayor and City Council discussed providing financial oversight of Measure T1 spending on a quarterly basis. This would be fiscally prudent and greatly welcome.Finally, because the train has already left the station with regard to how Measure T1 revenue might be spent, it is critically important that the people of Berkeley express their priorities soon - lest City Staff define them for us.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Op-ed: Berkeley's streets continue to deteriorate despite millions spent from Measure M", "Tags": "['Berkeley city budget', 'Berkeley City Council', 'Measure M', 'Measure T1']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Opinion', 'Transportation']", "Natural Language Location": "Sunset Lane", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.899053", "Zip Code": "94708", "ID": "247728", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.261625", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/09/op-ed-berkeleys-streets-continue-deteriorate-despite-millions-spent-measure-m/", "Author": "Guest contributor", "Date": "2017-02-09T09:00:27-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "More than 100 \"South Shattuck\" neighbors turned out to ask council to strike down Berkeley Honda's relocation plans. Photo: Emilie RagusoAfter more than five hours of public comment and council discussion Tuesday night, city officials found themselves deadlocked on a neighborhood appeal to halt Berkeley Honda's attempt to move into the old Any Mountain building on Shattuck Avenue.\nBerkeleyside live-tweeted many of the meeting highlightsBut that's not the end of the story. The saga is set to continue Feb. 28.\nFollowing a 15-minute monologue where Berkeley City Councilwoman Sophie Hahn said Honda knew the risks when it decided to leave its old location up the street, Hahn made a motion to approve the neighborhood appeal, which would have struck down the project's use permits and killed the plans.\nBut Hahn didn't have the votes. Council members Hahn, Cheryl Davila and Ben Bartlett, along with Mayor Jesse Arreguin, voted in favor of the appellants to deny the use permits.\n\nCouncil members Linda Maio, Susan Wengraf and Lori Droste abstained from the vote.\nAnd Councilman Kriss Worthington voted \"no\" on the appeal after saying he believed historic city planning and policy had paved the way for Berkeley Honda to move, whether he liked it or not.\nThe tie vote came about in part because there are only eight sitting members on the Berkeley City Council right now, with the downtown seat -- left vacant after Arreguin's successful mayoral run -- up for grabs in the March 7 election.\nAs per the city's rules, the item will now continue to appear on council agendas for 30 days and, if no action is taken, the use permits will be granted. The city's Zoning Adjustments Board voted 7-2 in favor of those permits in September.\nAccording to the city, the Berkeley Honda appeal will be on the Feb. 28 action calendar, and public comment will be taken. At least five votes would be needed to grant the appeal.\nWorthington said he hopes a compromise might be reached by the time that meeting rolls around.\nAli Kashani, representing Berkeley Honda, said Tuesday that there have been 11 public hearings in 30 months about the two-block move. The company was described repeatedly throughout the night as one of Berkeley's top five sales tax generators.\nIn November 2014, Berkeley Honda left its longtime location at 2600 Shattuck Ave. to make way for a large mixed-use development called Parker Place currently under construction in the neighborhood. After struggling since 2008 to find an appropriate new location, the business has said it came to an agreement with the property owner of 2777 Shattuck after Any Mountain requested an early termination of its lease there.\nThe neighborhood around Berkeley Honda has organized a strong campaign against the project as proposed, though many residents have said they support labor unions and support the business itself. One local resident, Steve Finacom, told council Tuesday night he'd tallied more than 80 people who came out to support the appeal, compared to 19 on the Honda side (many of whom had ties to the company or the project).\nThe Berkeley City Council listened to hours of public comment Tuesday night. Photo: Emilie RagusoAs is to be expected with such a hotly contested project that has such a lengthy history, a number of disputed facts and complexities have been raised. The most significant among them Tuesday night revolved around the word \"ancillary,\" and how it should be interpreted by city planners.\nIn an nutshell: Berkeley Honda proposes auto sales at 2777 Shattuck Ave., as well as auto service. The service element of the business is slated to take up 65% of the facility, even though the use is \"ancillary\" to the sales use.\nMany neighbors and some council members said that simply doesn't fly, and pointed to city code sections they believe support their position. The primary use of the facility, auto sales, should be the one using the bulk of the space and making up the bulk of the business, according to that perspective. And many local residents have said it is the service piece of the business they are most concerned about.\nRead all the Berkeley Honda background on Berkeleyside and see project documents on the city websiteOthers, including city staff, said various planning and zoning materials often conflict, but that it's possible to interpret city standards to allow for the 65%-service-to-35%-sales ratio, which staff also said is in line with the average breakdown of a handful of other nearby auto dealerships.\nCouncilman Worthington said previous Planning Commission discussions anticipated this issue, and intentionally used language that would allow for the ratio as described. He said, too, that when council created a special overlay in South Berkeley for auto uses, he became convinced -- though he was initially dubious -- about how hard the business tried to find an alternate location.\nMayor Arreguin and Councilwoman Hahn said they disagreed, and that an ancillary use is not allowed if it has different or greater impacts than the primary use.\nAnother issue that came up Tuesday night centered on whether proper notification had been done by the city for the meeting. Despite having set the Feb. 7 date as a special meeting dedicated solely to the appeal issue, the city sent a postcard that incorrectly listed March 7 as the meeting date (in addition to Feb. 7). Speakers said staff told them the meeting would likely be postponed, and also said their organizing, document submission and turnout efforts had been stymied as a result. Some also complained that the city has given unfair consideration and advantage to Berkeley Honda -- over neighborhood interests -- as the process has unfolded.\nCouncil discussed the notification issue but ultimately decided to hear the appeal Tuesday because so many people had turned out, and due to the challenges of finding a new date for the issue to be heard, particularly on its own night. Some speakers -- including an attorney for Berkeley Honda -- said the large turnout made it clear that the neighborhood had fair warning about the meeting.\nNeighborhood concerns included increased traffic problems in the area -- which they say is already too congested and dangerous, particularly for pedestrians -- insufficient parking on site, and the idea that having an auto service business on the parcel would not be the right fit for the neighborhood. Many pointed out the ongoing Adeline Corridor planning process and said plopping down the car dealership at 2777 Shattuck is out of line, and out of character, with how they hope their neighborhood will grow, particularly since the visioning is still underway.\nNeighbors also raised questions about the city's traffic study for the project, and submitted their own assessment of that study along with a letter from their attorney this past week. The city's traffic engineer said Tuesday he stands by the city's report and its accuracy.\nNeighbor George, who lives close enough to touch 2777 Shattuck, says he's concerned about project impacts. Photo: Emilie RagusoA representative for the Berkeley Chamber of Commerce said Honda has already spent $600,000 in rent for 2777 Shattuck, though it has not been allowed to move in.\nSome speakers said Honda will be forced to close if it can't resolve the issue soon. Others have said they are skeptical of that claim, and that they think it's just a pressure tactic to force the city's hand.\nThe Yasuda family, which owns 2777 Shattuck, pleaded in a letter to the city to let the deal go forward.\nBack in 2014, according to the letter, Any Mountain told the Yasudas it planned to close. Then, the Yasudas asked Berkeley Honda if it would like to move in.\n\"After they checked with the City Planning Department and were told, in writing, that their relocation was permitted under the zoning laws, and after they also got clearance from American Honda, we entered into a lease. Because zoning laws were in place, we all believed a relocation would take a short time -- possibly no more than a few months,\" the letter reads.\nThe Yasudas also pointed out that they are the owners of a nearby triangular lot that's part of the proposed Honda project, at 2747 Adeline St., which neighbors have said they would like to see as a park, not a parking lot. That land \"is our private property,\" the letter reads, \"and is not a 'public space' as some in the community have claimed.\"\n\n\nProperty owner Glen Yasuda says Any Mountain decision to leave came before Berkeley Honda plan to move in. His letter is here. #berkmtg pic.twitter.com/WJloILJdkf\n-- Berkeleyside (@berkeleyside) February 8, 2017\n\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Berkeley Honda move: One step closer?", "Tags": "['2600 Shattuck Ave.', '2747 Adeline', '2777 Shattuck Ave.', 'Adeline Corridor', 'Ali Kashani', 'Any Mountain', 'Berkeley City Council', 'Berkeley Honda', 'Shattuck Avenue', 'South Berkeley']", "Sections": "['Business', 'Business', 'City']", "Natural Language Location": "2777 Shattuck", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.859145", "Zip Code": "94705", "ID": "247672", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.266556", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/08/berkeley-honda-move-one-step-closer/", "Author": "Emilie Raguso", "Date": "2017-02-08T16:02:23-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Protesters at Sproul Plaza at UC Berkeley on Feb. 1. protesting the scheduled appearance of far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.

Arreguin tweeted: \"Bigotry is unacceptable. Hate speech isn't welcome in our community.\"\nOn Feb. 2, after a group of black-clad rioters protesting again Yiannopoulos had caused approximately $500,000 in damage downtown, and another $100,000 worth of damage to the UC campus, Arreguin put out a statement calling Yiannopoulos \"a white nationalist.\" Arreguin later retracted that characterization and changed it to \"alt-rightist.\" He apologized for his use of language.\n\nI consider much of what Mr. Yiannopoulos says to be hateful.

(The act of placing private information online with the intent to spur malicious acts is known as \"doxing.\") One to two officers shadowed Arreguin on Thursday and Friday, according to the mayor's office. Officers were also stationed at City Hall at 2180 Milvia St.\nThe threats spooked Arreguin, but he said he would not to be silenced.\n\"I was alarmed by the tone of the messages, and some of the threats,\" Arreguin told Berkeleyside in an email. \"I know going into public service and taking strong, principled stances against hatred, bigotry and racism that you are going to be a target.

But you don't know until it happens to you how disturbing it is, and how much you are at risk.\n\"That being said I am not going to back down from standing up for what I believe in and standing up against hate.

Berkeley police did not arrest anyone during the chaos.\nArreguin has said that he did not give any instructions to the police department about how to respond. But he said Tuesday he was proud of how police handled the situation.\n\"In terms of what happened on February 1st, I think our Police did a good job handling a very difficult situation and by focusing on life safety we were able to make sure that peaceful protesters were not at risk,\" Arreguin wrote. \"It is a tough call, but I think our Police made the right call.\"\nIn a tweet posted Thursday, Arreguin did condemn the violence of the band of black-clad protesters.\n\nI abhor violence.

The new glass doors of the Martin Luther King Jr. Student Union were shattered.  Blood flowed from the faces of those beaten. I inhaled tear gas deployed by the university police. I watched as officers in full riot-gear shot rubber bullets into the crowd of protesters. Wednesday night my campus was transformed into a war zone because Milo Yiannopoulos came to speak.\nThe Berkeley College Republicans decided to host the inflammatory bigot as a stop on his 18-campus Dangerous Faggot Tour. Despite outcries from concerned students, triggered by Milo's racist, misogynistic, Islamophobic and transphobic rhetoric, and the recent news of protesters being shot at Yiannopoulos' events, the College Republicans pledged to raise $10,000 to host him. When over 100 faculty members sent an open-letter to Chancellor Nicholas Dirks imploring him to cancel the event, a university-wide email was sent in reply refusing to ban the speaker and upholding his right to free expression.\nThe ironic invocation of the Free Speech Movement as protection for Yiannopoulos' hate speech is troubling in its own right, but most notably because our Chancellor has not otherwise been a strong defender of free speech on our campus. Last semester, Dirks cancelled a deCAL (Democratic Education at CAL), a peer-to-peer education course, largely organized by Muslim students that sought to explore the Israeli occupation of Palestine. The students went through the proper channels to secure a faculty sponsor and had the syllabus approved by the Academic Senate. Nonetheless, Dirks cancelled the course one week before the start of class for fear it might stir up anti-Semitism. Such actions protect neither free speech nor academic freedom, but they do send a clear message to our Muslim student population.\nBeyond being a violator of free speech in the classroom, Chancellor Dirks has seldom been a defender of other first-amendment rights, like the right of assembly. In 2015, he revised the UC Berkeley Code of Conduct, creating stricter sanctions for protests and demonstrations. In a time of major budgetary woes, with the campus running a $150 million structural deficit, the Chancellor spent $700,000 constructing a wrought-iron fence around his on-campus mansion, which is often a target of student demonstrations. An additional $9,000 was spent creating an emergency exit from his office in California Hall to evade student protests.\nMultiple student organizers involved in the Student Labor Committee at UC Berkeley have been met with harassment by Chancellor Dirks for their activism. In 2016 when Kristian Kim spoke out about labor violations, wage theft, and sexual assaults among outsourced contracted workers at the University of California, they were threatened with suspension from college. Another student was tackled by UCPD and charged with resisting arrest when he jumped on the Zellerbach stage to disrupt a performance and make an announcement about the horrific treatment of UC workers.\nAt UC Berkeley there is clearly a double standard for what is protected as free speech. Men like Milo Yiannopoulos, who incite violence at speaking engagements and publicly humiliate lesbians, feminists and transgender people, are given a stage, while students engaged in scholarship and social justice are actively silenced.\nOn Feb. 2 our Chancellor released a statement condemning the violence that ensued at Wednesday night's protest against Yiannopoulos. The Chancellor blamed outside agitators in \"ninja-like uniforms\" for the destruction of campus buildings, and said they violated Yiannopoulos' right to a public platform. But UC Berkeley is not an isolated ivory tower. Our campus is embedded within a city still reeling from Donald Trump's immigration ban that targets Muslims. Chancellor Dirks and the College Republicans refuse to take responsibility for hosting an Islamophobic provocateur in the MLK Student Union, which houses the Muslim Student Association as well as the Multicultural Community Center.\nRather than learning from the events that transpired at Yiannopoulos' engagement at UC Davis, or at the University of Washington and preemptively cancelling the event, the university called in police reinforcements from across the state to intimidate and terrorize protesters. Rather than remove one fascist from our campus, our Chancellor chose to invite rubber bullets, tear gas and handcuffs. Within a few hours, outside agitators were able to do what diplomatic students and faculty have failed to do for months - cancel Milo Yiannopoulos' event.

Photo: Emilie RagusoLast fall, the Downtown Berkeley Association (DBA) invited mayoral and City Council candidates to respond to eight questions regarding the future of downtown Berkeley. Now with the District 4 vacancy left by Jesse Arreguin, who was elected mayor, the DBA has asked these questions of both candidates -- Ben Gould and Kate Harrison -- in the March 7 special mail-in election. Answers appear unedited below.\n1. What is your near-term vision for the downtown and its role in the city? Your vision over the next four years? Ten years?\nBen Gould \nAs a resident of downtown Berkeley, I am very excited for its future. As the City Councilmember for District 4, I will strive to cultivate downtown Berkeley as a fully-realized neighborhood that is vibrant and welcoming for all.\nOver the next four years, I want to expand upon the success of the downtown Area Plan and the positive changes occurring downtown. The remodeled BART plaza, the Center Street hotel, and the new housing coming to downtown will all contribute to downtown Berkeley's increasing vibrancy; and I will work to ensure that the City continues to foster opportunities for new housing, businesses, and public realm improvements in the downtown. Upon completion of the new Center Street garage, I will also work to realize the vision of the Streets and Open Space Improvement Plan, with new pedestrian spaces, more parklets, and more efficient circulation. I also want to work with City staff, service providers, and our public safety officials to proactively and compassionately address ongoing issues with encampments and homelessness in the downtown.\n\nOver the next ten years, I want to pursue policies and projects that will solidify downtown Berkeley as a model of sustainability and a major destination for everyone, from Berkeley residents to international travelers. I will collaborate with regional transit agencies to improve public transportation facilities and access to the downtown. I will coordinate with the City's Office of Economic Development and the businesses community to enhance downtown's selection of high-quality retail. And I would work with historic preservationists and private developers to retrofit, restore, and adaptively reuse Old City Hall, the Veterans' Building, and the Downtown Berkeley Post Office.\nKate Harrison \nBerkeley's downtown is in the heart of Council District 4 and the City. The downtown can and should be the pride of every Berkeley resident, and especially those fortunate to live in close proximity to it. Within walking distance to the University of California, home of the Arts District and Berkeley's historic Civic Center, the commercial district should support thriving businesses that serve permanent residents, visitors, students, and alike. \nA vibrant downtown is critical to the City's ability to meet housing goals, mitigate climate impacts and promote economic development and continued cultural vitality. downtown development should be encouraged but with sensitivity to maintaining a vibrant streetscape with adequate light and open space, setbacks for surrounding residential neighborhoods and architecture that is unique and aesthetically compatible with surrounding buildings. We need to update the Streets and Open Space Plan (SOSIP), ask developers to include its features in their projects, and continue to seek funding for its elements. I served as a Commissioner on the committee and am proud of the vision incorporated in the plan, in particular making Center Street a shared street friendly to walkers, bicyclists and cafes, changing the traffic flow on the block around Shattuck Square, and adding other bicycle and pedestrian amenities. \nAdding the new hotel will make the downtown a much more viable destination. I support enhancements around the redesigned BART plaza, including public open space for informal gathering and planned events. We need to expedite completing the affordable housing and integrated homeless services/shelter/ transitional housing at Berkeley Way. These improvements can all be realized or at least begun in a four-year time horizon.\nOver the five to ten year perspective, downtown should become a showcase for environmental sustainability. We need to emphasize housing at all affordability levels downtown to reduce automobile traffic, green buildings, sustainable infrastructure and water recycling. Transit oriented development needs to serve us all, not just the affluent.\nExisting downtown businesses will need support through grants and loans while this transformation is taking place. \n2. What are your thoughts regarding the persistent street behavior challenges in the downtown, Telegraph and other areas in the city? Do you support the community sidewalks ordinances?\nKate Harrison \nI recognize the negative impacts that result from disruptive street behavior. Safety is critical to increasing the willingness of residents and visitors to come here and the economic vitality of the area and the City as a whole. \nWhen the disruption involves illegal activities, individual perpetrators should be cited or arrested to address the behavior. It needs to be recognized that disruptive street behavior is not synonymous with homelessness. Sufficient laws are on the books now - what we need is enforcement, not new laws which are overly broad, potentially criminalize innocent activities and invite unequal treatment. \nPart and parcel of stopping some of the most disturbing, if not most criminal, behavior, would involve providing more public toilets (e.g., self-cleaning/opening ones made by JC Decaux). I support some limitations on property kept by the homeless on the street so that all of us can safely use the sidewalks but the prior two-foot ordinance was overly restrictive. However, this will require that we identify locations for the homeless to store their belongings. \nThe City moved quickly recently to increase shelter beds/warming centers and provide transportation between shelters and daily visits from staff. This emergency response is necessary but is not a long-term solution. I would work with the current City Council to implement solutions being developed to deal with homelessness. Housing first should be our goal, modeled after San Francisco, Portland, Seattle and other communities, and collaborating regionally. A new project on Berkeley Way will provide transitional housing for the first time for single men. However, the number of available units falls far below the need. I fully support creating tiny house villages and other solutions for relatively inexpensive but stable housing and working toward regional solutions. The recently passed A1 county housing and homeless services bond and U1 Berkeley increase in the business license tax both give us enhanced resources to approach this problem. We need to identify other new funding sources and shift some existing funds to expand mental health/social work crisis teams to a 24/7 schedule and move away from police being required to respond to mental health crises. \nFor some adults, providing housing will be enough. For others, wrap around services are needed. For youth, re-housing may involve interventions with family or mediation with roommates. For the mentally ill, I support Laura's Law which requires those with mental health issues to appear in court to discuss available services.\nBefore these solutions become a reality, we have to implement immediate measures. I support a sanctioned tent city with sanitation facilities, services and some self-governance.\nMost importantly, we need to recognize that the problem of homelessness does not occur in a vacuum; it is linked to the displacement crisis caused by rising rents, elimination of SROs, and conversion of formerly rent controlled units. Efforts to stop displacement through protection and expansion of affordable housing are critical.\nBen Gould \nI will work continuously to keep our public commons clean, safe, and welcoming for everyone, while standing firmly against criminalizing homelessness. Unlike my opponent, I do not support allowing encampments to go unchecked and I do not think that encampments are an acceptable \"solution\" to homelessness in Berkeley. Encampments are not welcoming to homeless families, particularly women and children, and do not address the actual problem of homelessness.\nAllowing encampments to \"self-police\" is also unacceptable. As citizens and a city, we make, follow, and enforce rules that ensure equal, fair, and just treatment and protection. Encampments do not get to operate under a different set of rules from everyone else in Berkeley. I will work with City staff, mental health workers, homeless individuals, neighborhoods, and public safety officials to ensure that the City ordinances that protect everyone's health and safety are consistently, compassionately, and fairly enforced.\nBerkeley needs to engage in long-term, regional efforts that focus first and foremost on affordable housing. We need to address the root causes of homelessness, and provide real solutions--not \"quick fixes\"--and make sure these responsibilities are shared by all Bay Area cities. The passage of Berkeley Measure U1 and Alameda County Measure A1 mean that Berkeley has new funds available for housing, emergency shelters, and homeless services. As the representative for District 4, my priorities to address homelessness include:\nCollaborating with neighboring cities and regional governments, with the goal of ensuring that no one experiences homelessness in Alameda County.\nBuilding on the success of the City's Homeless Coordinated Entry (the \"Hub\") by funding programs with a track record of success, reducing duplicative services, and strengthening a \"continuum\" of care.\nExpanding access to public restrooms, shelters, and warming centers.\nPursuing creative solutions to provide housing for the homeless, including micro-units, tiny homes, and public-private partnerships.\nI believe the Community Sidewalks Ordinance was well-intended, but flawed. As a community, we should set and uphold expectations about how everyone in Berkeley should treat and use our public spaces. We also have to make sure that those expectations are reasonable and fair for everyone. I support working collaboratively to ensure Berkeley adopts policies and programs that:\nEnsure that shelters and service providers have sufficient and well-managed storage space for homeless individuals;\nEnsure our public spaces are available to be fairly, safely, and comfortably used by all;\nEmphasize outreach, supportive services, and treatment for addiction and other mental health issues; and\nEngage in regular reevaluation and fine-tuning to ensure we are in engaging best practices that are fair and effective.\n3. What is your perception regarding parking in the downtown? Do you support the DBA position of doubling the parking at the city's Berkeley Way lot in the event the parcel is developed?\nBen Gould \nParking in downtown can be difficult, and this is definitely a challenge for those who lack adequate public transit access or who otherwise need to use a private vehicle. However, given the goals of creating a vibrant, walkable, and sustainable downtown, I want to encourage alternatives to driving and reduce the amount of public space needed for parking. Meanwhile, services like Uber and Lyft are increasing popular, and autonomous vehicles appear likely to become a reality in the not-too-distant future. For these reasons, I don't believe that large amounts of new parking are the answer.\nInstead, we need smarter parking, improved transit, and better bicycle infrastructure. I want to build on the success of the goBerkeley parking program, which adopted demand-responsive pricing and time limits, and dramatically improved parking signage in the downtown. By adapting the prices and hours for paid parking to reflect typical or even real-time demand, we can encourage long-term parking in garages, ensure on-street spaces are available for short-term parking, and reduce circling and congestion in the downtown. By improving transit and bike access to downtown, we can make it more convenient for people to leave their cars at home and visit downtown on foot or on a bicycle, bus, or BART.\nI believe that these approaches and coming changes to the transportation system are likely to make doubling the parking at the Berkeley Way lot unnecessary. The purpose of the Berkeley Way project is to provide homeless services, emergency shelter, and affordable/supportive housing. I am not inclined to support doubling parking at this location because I believe doing so would negatively impact project feasibility and costs, making it more difficult to provide this critically needed supportive housing. I also believe that doubling this parking would run counter to Berkeley's climate action goals and Transit-First policies.\nKate Harrison \nEasy access to downtown is our goal. Providing parking for those lacking alternative transportation options is a must. While I support increased parking, I will advocate for viable alternatives such as enhanced bicycle lanes and parking; well lit streetscapes to encourage walking; and creating a city-wide shuttle services to connect residents between all eight districts and the downtown. A good model to examine is the Emery-go-round\" shuttle that provides free between BART and Emeryville commercial areas. The City could encourage larger businesses to provide shuttle services for employees and local residents. Sutter Health currently transports its workforce, patients, and local residents between BART, Alta Bates and Herrick's and Sutter's Milvia Street campuses. This community benefit is worth adopting as part of new business development. \nNevertheless, some residents will need to drive to downtown some of the time, particularly the elderly, those with small children, those picking up materials that cannot be carried on transit, merchants and night-time visitors. We should build upon Go Berkeley's Transportation Demand Management. Parking meter and garage fees that reflect times of heaviest use should be expanded. More signage about where parking available is needed to reduce emissions from idling and circling the block. Garage parking should be incentivized by charging less; however, for this to be effective, garages need to be and feel safe. Reserved parking should be provided at the top, not the bottom level of garages to encourage quicker in and out and charging stations need to be expanded.\nAny parking that is built should incorporate a maximum of green features and be built in a way that allows conversion to other uses such as housing when car sharing, autonomous cars and better transit significantly reduce need for parking in the very near future. \nI do not support doubling the parking at the Berkeley Way parking lot as it will add significantly to the cost of the affordable housing being built there. Our focus should be on the City of the future, using the elements discussed above.\n4. What are your ideas for making Berkeley more welcoming environment for new businesses, particularly for retail and office space in the downtown? \nKate Harrison \nRetail and office properties help define the unique character of any commercial district. In recent years the downtown has experienced an exodus of small and locally owned businesses. Commercial rents are prohibitively high for small and new business owners; we need to create financial incentives to offset this barrier. Included in my platform are proposals for a grant program for legacy businesses, as exists in San Francisco, a one stop center for small business with over the counter permits for the most straightforward requests, and vacancy taxes to discourage blight. More of the focus of the economic development staff should be directed to these unique businesses and art amenities. Investments in public spaces will also create an environment supportive of small and local businesses in particular. \nThe ambassadors as originally conceptualized are an important addition to the downtown. The sidewalks are cleaner, the plantings look better and businesses and visitors have a visible presence to whom to address concerns. However, their role must be strictly limited to beautification and reporting incidents to others with the experience and training to diffuse difficult situations.\nBen Gould \nDowntown Berkeley already features numerous amenities that make it attractive to businesses, but there is still much we can do to remove the obstacles to starting and running a business in downtown Berkeley.\nI want to make Berkeley a more welcoming environment for new businesses by ensuring that the permitting process is simple and straightforward, and by offering more assistance to businesses trying to find space in Berkeley. The City has already made some improvements to its permitting systems, but I think we could go much farther. Permitting should be a service provided by the City, not an obstacle to doing business in Berkeley. As the representative for the economic center of Berkeley, I would make it a priority to revamp the City website and adopt a \"customer service\" approach to the permitting process. Additionally, I want the City to explore innovative programs that could help existing businesses find new spaces when their current spaces are considered for redevelopment.\nFor Berkeley to attract, create, and retain new businesses, those businesses need space and room to grow. To do this, we need to continue to create new housing, office, retail, and cultural spaces in downtown Berkeley. Businesses also need to know that their employees will able to find housing that they can easily access and afford. Right now, the entire Bay Area is facing a housing crisis that makes it hard for businesses to recruit all but the highest-paid workers. Berkeley needs to ensure we have ample affordable housing to foster new business creation and local hiring.\nLastly, new businesses spun out from the University would benefit greatly from additional resources and opportunities for collaborative partnerships. It can be challenging to make the transition from laboratory or research settings and into the world of startups and real office space. Creating new spaces for offices and commercial laboratories in downtown could further help new businesses, especially with the easy transit access to Berkeley Lab and University research facilities. I would also like to explore opportunities for the creation of larger office spaces so that our most successful locally-founded businesses have room to grow.\n5. What is your vision and ideas for revitalization of the Civic Center Historic District?\nBen Gould \nBerkeley's historic Civic Center has fallen into disrepair and disuse. I support reinvesting and restoring our parks, historic buildings, and public infrastructure through new spending and/or public-private partnerships. I would like to see the Berkeley High School Community Theater and the Little Theater restored and used more frequently for public performances, which can charge admission to help defray the cost of the renovations. Similarly, I will push for the repair and modernization of Civic Center Park to encourage more regular public events, such as food stands, live music, movie nights, markets, and festivals. I also want to retrofit, restore, and adaptively reuse Old City Hall and the Veterans Memorial Building. By exploring options for a mixture of public and private uses, we could offset costs and restore the role of these buildings in Berkeley's public life.\nKate Harrison\nPreserving and revitalizing the historic character of Berkeley's Civic Center will help insure our city's aesthetic and cultural identity. We need develop a funding source to rehabilitate the Maudelle Shirek old City Hall building and refurbish the Civic Center Park behind City Hall. The recent street improvements along Center Street and Allston between Milvia and Martin Luther King Jr. Way are a step in the right direction. I would like to extend this trend with street beautification along MLK Jr. Way and Shattuck Avenue retaining the early 19th century era design influences. I believe we should expand the historic district's boundary to include all pre-war construction along this corridor, including the Shattuck Hotel and the Herrick Campus.\nAttractions and activities in the area could include an expanded historical museum and live performances. The farmers' market needs more programming. The live music and poetry readings at El Cerrito, Santa Cruz and other farmers' markets create an inviting environment. More specific activities for children would also add to the attraction. The efforts to add the food courts on different days is a good start. Also, the nature of the layout in a long strip is not inviting. Perhaps more of the park could be used for the market as is true in other cities. We should also work with the school district to reopen and creatively use the Berkeley High Theater and Florence Schwimley Little Theater (I saw Frank Zappa there!). \nPublic/private partnerships should be encouraged, with the addition of a Friends of the Civic Center.\n6. Would you support public/private partnerships to adaptively reuse the Downtown Post Office?\nKate Harrison\nThe U.S. Post Office on Allston Way is a historically landmarked building. I support it remaining a public asset with the inclusion of public banking. The rear portion of the Post Office could be a community resource for one of the uses allowed by the Civic Center Overlay. I would support a comprehensive and inclusive process to decide its future use. Factors to consider are its local and national historical significance; central location; and proximity to other civic institutions. Performing arts groups are woefully short of space in Berkeley. As mentioned by Sophie Hahn, using the rear of the building as a concert hall is one possible creative reuse.\nBen Gould \nYes. The Downtown Berkeley Post Office is a treasured part of downtown's historic fabric and part of Berkeley's unique architectural heritage. I am committed to preserving the historic front section of the Post Office and to ensuring that this portion of the building, like the Civic Center, continues to play a role in Berkeley's public life.\nI am open to supporting the relocation of post office services to another location, if it creates an opportunity to restore and adaptively reuse the elegant lobby. I want to explore the potential for a public-private partnership to create a new attraction and resource for downtown Berkeley. I'm very excited about the potential to create a performance/event space, a museum, or even a market hall in the main building, while considering additional options for the warehouse portion.\n7. What is your vision for public art in the downtown, including visual and performing arts? Also, what is your vision for additional visual and/or performing arts venues in the downtown?\nBen Gould \nI am excited about the direction downtown is moving with the existing Arts District, the new Berkeley Art Museum / Pacific Film Archive, the newly renovated UC Theater, and the upcoming improvements to Shattuck Cinemas. Additionally, with the \"1% for the Arts\" requirement, new construction in downtown will add to public art or make a contribution to the city's art fund, further enhancing our city.\nI will continue to support the arts in downtown, especially around the Arts District. I believe having a diverse range of activities and businesses in downtown is crucial for keeping it vibrant and thriving, and the arts serve as an important year-round attractor, stimulating other businesses and activities, and making downtown an appealing place for new businesses and residents to locate. I would like to see the Berkeley High Community Theater and Little Theater renovated and used for more community events, and see Civic Center Park used for live open-air music and festivals.\nKate Harrison \nBerkeley has made a good start at establishing the downtown district as an arts center. Home to two regionally acclaimed theatres, jazz and theatre schools, music venues, media centers, museums and film archives, it is a destination point for art enthusiasts of all disciplines. The next step is to build upon this foundation by expanding public access and participation in the arts. I would encourage better utilization of open space and under-used commercial spaces. The renovated BART plaza will provide a focal point to develop public art, both visual and performance. How we allocate our dedicated budget line for arts-funding is worth examining - we need to use the funding for more living, interactive art and fewer static pieces. More use could be made of vacant storefronts and lots as art spaces.\n8. What do you see as the critical management and financial issues facing the city over the next several years? \nKate Harrison\nThe challenge in managing and balancing our City's budget is not only to identify the most crucial priorities but also to insure that actual performance is measured. My career has been devoted to improving the way public sector agencies use resources - financial, human and capital - to ensure they are meeting their goals in the most efficient way possible. The government cannot do it all and must keep in mind the primary goals we are trying to achieve. I would advocate for a comprehensive strategic plan, a process I have managed for cities, states and countries working to enter the European Union. Clarity and more transparency regarding the budget process will instill public trust in our government.\nOne way we can improve city services is to invest in technologies that support better management decision making and transparency. The new financial system under development is only one part of that. Other software applications that need updating are those related to the business license process. As discovered during the campaign for the recent increase in the business license tax on larger landlords, we are losing potentially millions of dollars in potential revenues by not comparing data across available data bases between the Finance Department and the Rent Board.\nTechnological improvements to ease access for its citizens and business owners is also a priority as they will improve services and help save staff time. Technology to expand citizen participation in council proceedings is in place in many municipalities and should be introduced here. \nAnother key management opportunity involves capitalizing on the twin tools of U1 for affordable housing and T1 for infrastructure spending. A challenge for the City is to not carry out business as usual but to insure that these funds are used to support housing for all people below the median income and insure we are using infrastructure funds sustainably.\nThe issue of pension and retiree health benefits is real but should not be exaggerated. As with having a mortgage which may not be payable all at once today, we need to insure we know how this obligation will be paid over its lifespan. Defined benefit pension plans are the backbone of a secure, middle class. We also have contractual obligations to those whom we have employed. This situation did not arise in a day nor will it be solved in the short run and it cannot be solved by not honoring our obligations. We need to come together in negotiations to address the situation. Employees have already begun to contribute to retirement and we have instituted a two-tier system and more will need to be done. The more serious debt issue relates to retiree health which in reality can only be solved with a single-payer health system.\nIncreasing revenues is also a key priority. Working to meet the needs of the small business community and investment in the downtown and commercial districts will boost city revenues. On a local level, I support increasing the transfer tax on property sales above a certain value (e.g., $5 million) and assessments for parks, transportation and other infrastructure for which new developments create new demands. \nBen Gould \nI think the biggest financial issues facing the City are ensuring we have a strong reserve fund to protect against the likelihood of an economic downturn in the next few years; and addressing our unfunded capital and pension needs. Fortunately, the current reserve fund is over 12% of the General Fund, and only requires prudent policies and good stewardship to preserve and grow. However, addressing our unfunded capital and pension needs will be more challenging, with $500 million needed to address deferred maintenance and capital improvements alone (a number that dwarfs the $160 million General Fund). The passage of Measure T1, $100 million for infrastructure spending, is a step in the right direction. However, it will only begin to pay down the backlog, and do nothing to address the ongoing structural deficit.\nBerkeley needs a comprehensive review and plan to address this structural deficit and rebuild our public resources, likely through some combination of efficiency improvements, adjustments in level of service, economic development, and tax adjustments. I also want to work with City staff to expedite the replacement of the obsolete, floppy-disk-era FUND$ system for budget tracking. Modern budgeting and record-keeping software is essential to making City operations and budgeting more transparent and efficient. By working with City staff, other Councilmembers, and up-to-date technology, I will push for new cost-saving and revenue-generating opportunities for the City.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "DBA: Candidates weigh in on the future of downtown Berkeley", "Tags": "['Ben Gould', 'Berkeley City Council election', 'Berkeley elections', 'Berkeley politics', 'District 4', 'Downtown Berkeley', 'Downtown Berkeley Association', 'Election 2016 Berkeley', 'Kate Harrison']", "Sections": "['2016 Election', '2016 Election', 'City', 'Downtown', 'Politics']", "Natural Language Location": "City Council District 4", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.86968", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "247526", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.270894", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/07/dba-candidates-weigh-in-on-the-future-of-downtown-berkeley/", "Author": "Guest contributor", "Date": "2017-02-07T08:05:05-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Photo: Courtesy of Ben GouldName: Ben Gould\nAge: 25\nJob: Graduate student researcher\nWhat is the main reason you are running? I'm running for City Council because I believe in Berkeley's future and the future of our Downtown. We should have an elected representative who understands the experiences of everyone living in the district, and that believes that better times for our City lie ahead, not behind. As someone who was born and raised here, I love Berkeley; and I will work tirelessly to ensure it will become more affordable, inclusive, and sustainable. I will bring a fresh perspective to City Council and ensure we have a range of perspectives when making decisions that affect future generations.\n\nWhy are you qualified for the position? The diversity and depth of my expertise and experience make me uniquely qualified to serve as District 4's City Councilmember, and ensures I will hit the ground running. I am currently finishing two Masters degrees, in Public Policy and in Environmental Engineering, at UC Berkeley; I've spent years working as a policy analyst; and before that, I was an engineer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I was born in Berkeley, went to Berkeley public schools, and graduated from Berkeley High, so I've witnessed Berkeley's promise and its challenges. I've worked hard to meet these challenges, building a wide-ranging record of progressive victories and service in Berkeley. On the UC Berkeley Graduate Assembly, I fought for - and won - access to LGBT-inclusive health care for all students. As Chair of the Community Environmental Advisory Commission, I fought for the health of our children and our soil against lead poisoning, and I developed green building and indoor air quality standards. I have also served on the Housing Advisory Commission, the Zoning Adjustments Board, and the Police Review Commission. I will draw on my exceptional qualifications to craft and implement workable, progressive solutions to help our city rise to its challenges.\nWhat sets you apart from other candidates? My lived experience, my positive vision for Berkeley's future, and my fact-based approach to policymaking.\nI am a graduate student living in Downtown, and was born and raised in Berkeley. I understand the challenges faced not only by families and homeowners, but also by renters and young people. My opponent moved here when rents were affordable and hasn't grappled firsthand with our housing crisis.\nI believe that creating more housing across all income levels is essential to keeping Berkeley vibrant, sustainable, and inclusive. My opponent, on the other hand, is more concerned with erecting bureaucratic hurdles than building housing; and has even disregarded independent economic analyses in her opposition to new housing Downtown. I will fight to create housing that gives students, young people, and low- and moderate-income families an equal opportunity to call Berkeley home.\nI am a pragmatic progressive. I am driven by values of fairness, equity, and social justice; and my decision-making will be grounded in data, realism, and the perspectives of constituents. I've been endorsed by Dan Kammen, Distinguished Professor of Energy; and Professor Karen Chapple, head of the Urban Displacement Project, because they believe I am the best candidate to translate policy ideas into practice.\nHow did you end up in Berkeley? Berkeley has always been my home. I was born at Alta Bates Hospital, and attended Berkeley public schools from kindergarten through Berkeley High School. I went to UC San Diego for my undergraduate degree, but soon after arriving I realized I love Berkeley too much to stay away for long. Just days after graduating, I moved back to Berkeley, got an engineering job at Lawrence Berkeley Lab and an apartment in Downtown, and haven't regretted it once. I'm proud to now be completing my graduate degrees at UC Berkeley, and looking forward to continuing to work to improve my community.\nWhat are the three biggest challenges Berkeley faces in the near future? The three biggest challenges that Berkeley faces are housing affordability, homelessness, and resiliency.\nBerkeley faces an unprecedented housing crisis. For students, seniors, teachers, nurses, low-income families, and too many others, finding housing they can afford is near impossible. Rapid job creation throughout the Bay Area is bringing in new workers faster than we are creating housing. The resulting shortage enables landlords to rent or sell only to the very highest bidders, leaving everyone else struggling to find homes they can afford. This is a regional issue, but there is still a lot we can do in Berkeley to help alleviate the problem.\nThe severity of homelessness in Berkeley is a product of both the crisis of housing affordability and insufficient social and mental health services. Homelessness was a problem before the current housing crisis, but a shortage of affordable housing has exacerbated the problem. Involuntary homelessness is an extraordinary struggle for those who experience it, and it also puts stress on our civic resources, including our public spaces, business districts, and City budget and staff. However, with new funding, implementation of best practices, and regional coordination, we can better help our homeless neighbors secure the housing and care they need.\nLastly, we need to ensure Berkeley is a resilient community able to weather economic downturns, a changing climate, and higher infrastructure demands. Berkeley has over $500 million in deferred maintenance and needed capital improvements. We need to tackle these infrastructure needs to ensure the City runs smoothly and is prepared for natural disasters. Berkeley must also strive to meet its climate change prevention and adaptation goals by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, conserving water, and increasing the share of energy we use from renewable sources. Finally, we have to achieve all of this within a realistic and responsible budget.\nWhat are your ideas to solve them? Housing affordability, homelessness, and resiliency are closely intertwined, and I am determined to tackle them comprehensively on the City Council.\nTo preserve our values of diversity, inclusiveness, and opportunity while addressing this housing shortage, I want to pursue an array of policies and build more housing for people at all income levels, focused along transit corridors. I will defend Berkeley's tenant protections and push for improved zoning that establishes clear, consistent requirements, to encourage the creation of housing that meets high but achievable affordability and environmental standards. Our commercial and transit corridors offer ample opportunities for new housing that will help us achieve our affordability goals and enhance Berkeley's community fabric, so we can do all of this while continuing to respect Berkeley's architectural heritage and diverse neighborhoods.\nThis affordable housing is needed as part of a regional housing-first approach to addressing the root causes of homelessness. I will focus on expanding upon the success of the City's Homeless Coordinated Entry (the \"Hub\") by funding programs with a track record of success, reducing duplicative services, and strengthening a continuum of care. I will pursue creative solutions to provide housing for the homeless, including micro-units, tiny homes, and public-private partnerships. I will stand firmly against criminalizing homelessness, but encampments are not an acceptable solution - we need to keep our public spaces clean, safe, and welcoming for everyone.\nTo make our community more resilient, I want to focus on repairing and upgrading our infrastructure, adapting to a changing climate, and improving our City's financial situation. By encouraging economic development and adopting more cost-effective budgeting, we can improve our City's financial position to achieve other goals. I would also prioritize upgrading our electrical grid, roadways, and stormwater systems, to prepare Berkeley for natural disasters and ensure a more sustainable future.\nWhat is your most inspired/unique idea for Berkeley? Reactivating Berkeley's Civic Center as a focal point for the community to come together and connect with their City government.\nHow will you be accessible to constituents? I will hold regular office hours at coffee shops around District 4, semi-regular hours at the Downtown Farmers' Market, and by appointment. I will respond to emails and phone calls within 24 hours, and will send out a monthly newsletter. Lastly, I will also actively reach out to the community, to get input and feedback on issues facing Berkeley and to remain up-to-date on the experiences of every resident.\nHow much money do you expect to spend on your campaign? I expect to raise over $20,000 for my campaign.\nA final thought? I would be honored to serve my neighbors in District 4 and across Berkeley as your representative on City Council. I am fortunate and thankful that Berkeley has been my home my entire life, and I want to ensure Berkeley is a place that is welcoming and affordable for all so that others can have the same opportunities to live here that I have had.

I care profoundly about Berkeley and the people who live here. I look forward to giving back to the community that has given me so much. As is true for all cities, Berkeley is on the brink of major change. Greater housing density paired with less reliance on the personal automobile will change the way our city looks and feels. At the same time, we are suffering increasing economic and racial inequality and environmental challenges. I want to bring my extensive experience to help craft sustainable, equitable and effective solutions to these challenges while enhancing the quality of our daily lives.\n\nWhy are you qualified for the position? My qualifications for City Council include over three decades as a small business owner, public sector manager and community activist. This council seat needs an experienced voice. My years of developing and prioritizing budgets will allow me to balance government effectiveness, access and protection for the most vulnerable. I worked in policy and executive positions in San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos' Office, on the redesign of the Embarcadero Waterfront and at the California Administrative Office of the Courts, where I helped develop the budget and policies for and enhance access to California's $1.7 billion-a-year court system. I have a long history of activism in Berkeley and service on non-profit boards. I serve on Berkeley's Parks and Waterfront Commission, chairing its Sustainability Subcommittee, and the Housing Advisory Commission, reflecting my years of experience in funding and advocacy for affordable housing in Berkeley, San Francisco and the State of California. I also have specific knowledge and experience of issues of the Downtown - a vital part of District 4 - having served on the Downtown Streets and Open Space Advisory Committee. As a Board member for Berkeley Food and Housing, I have specific ideas for addressing the challenges of homelessness.\nWhat sets you apart from other candidates? My extensive professional, community and political experience and a track record of advancing progressive policy ideas within the fiscal and management constraints faced by cities. I have tackled hard issues head on, keeping in mind the residents for whom services are intended and those for whom government is a lifeline. My service on several City commissions and non-profit boards and involvement in community activities has given me a deep understanding of many of the most salient issues in the City. As a long-term resident of District 4, I also know the particular concerns of the District's constituents. I am proud to have the enthusiastic support of a diverse group of elected officials, environmental groups, labor unions and community leaders, including Assembly member Tony Thurmond, Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin, former Mayors Gus Newport and Shirley Dean, the Sierra Club, the Alameda County Labor Council, the Alameda County Green Party, the Berkeley Firefighters' Association, BART Director Lateefah Simon, the Berkeley Tenants' Union, Berkeley Progressive Alliance, Berkeley Citizens Action and the Progressive Student Association.\nHow did you end up in Berkeley? I came to Berkeley as an undergraduate, was elected to the Associated Student Senate, worked on the initial rent control measure here, stayed through my first job analyzing disparate impacts of the Alameda County criminal justice system and then attended the Goldman School of Public Policy. While my work has taken me all over the world (to 14 countries) and throughout the U.S., I have always called Berkeley home. I love our community and its racial and economic diversity and intellectual, political and cultural vibrancy.\nWhat are the three biggest challenges Berkeley faces in the near future? \n1. Expanding and Protecting Affordable Housing/Preventing Displacement: Housing affordability is key to maintaining the ethnic, economic and cultural diversity and intellectual vibrancy that make Berkeley what it is. Our greatest housing need is for low and moderate income housing, where we are far below regional standards. Rents have risen over 50% since 2000. Having served on the Measure U1 campaign committee, I am proud that Berkeley voters approved $4 million/year for affordable housing. Market rate housing developments also provide funds for affordable housing. However, much more needs to be done.\n2. Preserving Our Environment: Buildings, agriculture and transportation are the biggest contributors to climate change. Berkeley has to address each of these areas through specific proposals while simultaneously improving our quality of life. We also need to tackle local environmental issues related to Bay and creek protection, reducing waste and increasing recycling/reuse, and combating pollutants from some of our factories.\n3. Revitalizing Our Downtown and Economic Development: A vibrant downtown will help the City meet its housing goals, mitigate climate impacts and promote economic development and continued cultural vitality. We need to encourage business and cultural amenities in the Downtown, but with sensitivity to a vibrant streetscape, light and open space, residential neighborhood setbacks and aesthetically compatible architecture. Our Downtown Streets and Open Space Plan (SOSIP) needs to be updated, developers asked to include its features in their projects, and funding sought for its elements. Small, local-serving businesses, our greatest economic engine, need planning and development support. Community policing, better lighting and sidewalks would make our commercial districts more inviting.\nThese challenges exist simultaneously with the imperative to manage the City budget and effectively and efficiently deliver services. We will likely need to manage funding reductions from the Federal government and methodically reduce unfunded liabilities while advancing our priorities.\nWhat are your ideas to solve them?\n1. Expanding Affordable Housing/Preventing Displacement: I support 1) funding affordable housing through short-term rental taxes, regular adjustments to the affordable housing fee and some transfer tax funds and 2) measures to prevent displacement. We nimbly identify/approve affordable housing projects, particularly along transit corridors. As on the Housing Advisory Commission , I will work to streamline permitting and provide seed money for affordable housing projects; purchase existing rental housing to maintain affordability; evaluate publicly owned sites for housing; and build more student housing close to campus.\n2. Preserving our Environment. My priorities include:\n* Reducing emissions through Zero Net Energy standards and Community Green Energy; incentivizing urban agriculture, green roofs and water savings; a transportation services fee and using funds from PG&E and the Volkswagen settlement for alternatives like a Downtown shuttle and electric vehicle charging.\n* Keeping our Bay, creeks and parks clean through permeable surfaces, improved street drains, street cleaning, swales and cisterns.\n* Expanding parks and public open space, including parklets, community gardens, a reopened Willard Pool and the proposed Center Street Plaza.\n* Requiring new development to pay open space fees to reflect the additional density created.\n3. Revitalizing Our Downtown/Economic Development: The City should proactively plan for the Downtown it wants and invite businesses and the community to help us achieve that vision. I do not support overly-prescriptive ballot measures limiting development but we also shouldn't passively accept whatever occurs. Instead, t Better use of public space (including the redesigned BART plaza) and under-used commercial spaces could be made. To mitigate the impact of development on city services and existing residents and businesses, I support assessing housing, transportation and open space fees. I propose a vacancy tax on long-term vacant commercial properties and a legacy business program providing grants and assistance to unique, local-serving businesses.\nWhat is your most inspired/unique idea for Berkeley? I would like to expand the current program helping building owners pay for energy improvements through their property taxes to include safety improvements for artists' live/work spaces to avoid repeating the tragedy at the Oakland Ghost Ship. We cannot afford to lose our creative community either through disaster or displacement.\nHow will you be accessible to constituents? I will proactively reach out to constituents through community issue forums, on-line forums, neighborhood gatherings, appointment of diverse people to Commissions, and ongoing consultation with commissioners to insure I am hearing all perspectives.\nHow much money do you expect to spend on your campaign? $35,000 from a wide variety of donors.\nA final thought? I am the most qualified, experienced candidate running for District 4. It will be my pleasure to serve the city of Berkeley as a Council member and believe I will do an excellent job. I ask for your support and that you join me in making our City the best it can be.\nLearn more about Kate Harrison on her website.

Preston Jordan (left) moderates. Photo: Emilie RagusoEarly voting began Monday, Feb. 6, for downtown Berkeley residents who want a say in who will represent them on the City Council.\nFormer district Councilman Jesse Arreguin was elected mayor of the city in November after longtime Mayor Tom Bates stepped down, leaving an open seat on council until the election takes place. The two candidates on the ballot are Kate Harrison and Ben Gould.\nScroll down to learn how to cast your ballot. Watch the full forum down below.In January, candidates faced off in a televised forum hosted by the League of Women Voters of Berkeley Albany and Emeryville. In response to questions from moderator Preston Jordan, a member of the league board, they shared views on development, homelessness, infrastructure, Alta Bates and more.\nHarrison said she wants to see \"balanced development in Berkeley,\" do more to protect the environment, and believes the city can \"do better\" in terms of the building that does happen. She said she thinks the city can also provide the services it offers at lower costs.\n\nGould say his focus would be to help create a \"vibrant walkable city with access to abundant transit and biking infrastructure,\" and is concerned about housing availability. He said he'd like to get more of the homeless into shelters, and wants to increase the city's resilience to natural disasters.\nModerator Jordan asked both candidates to say more about their positions on housing. Gould said he wants to see housing with more transit access through the city and downtown. Harrison said, though she is \"not against market-rate housing,\" she has concerns about the impacts of development on neighbors, and that the city should pay close attention to setbacks, light and noise, and architectural integrity for all proposed projects.\nHarrison said, though she herself was able to live near campus when she studied at UC Berkeley, more should be done now \"to limit some of the growth from the university.\" She also said she is concerned about some of the \"large-scale\" development happening \"in our neighborhoods.\"\nBerkeleyside questionnaire with both candidates will be posted shortlyGould took a different approach, and said the city of Berkeley will benefit as the university grows. The real question, he added, is how the city can help UC grow, and work to shape that growth, and how UC expansion will impact the city in return. Gould said there should be more housing downtown and in the Northside neighborhood to ensure university growth happens \"in a way that works best for everybody.\"\nGould said there won't be enough housing in Berkeley if the city only focuses on affordable housing, and that market-rate housing must have a place, too.\nHarrison talked about protections for rent control, and the need to limit short-term rentals such AirBNB properties.\nMoving on to homelessness, Harrison said the way to fix it is to provide more housing. She said, regarding those experiencing homelessness, for \"many of them, that is the entire problem they face.\" She said, too, she is not in favor of building \"extreme tall buildings\" at BART, though some housing at the stations would be good.\nGould said addressing homelessness needs a regional approach, in which Berkeley must take a leadership role, and that he is in favor of \"across the board all-income housing.\"\nOn the question of infrastructure, in relation to the recently approved T1 bond measure, Gould said he'd like to see Civic Center Park revitalized, including improvements to the fountain and an extension of the farmers market into the park.\nHarrison said she'd like to see more permeable paving in the city to improve impacts of wastewater run-off on the city's aging sewers.\nOn the question of what distinguishes the candidates from each other, Gould, 25, said he has had a life-long commitment to the city. He grew up in Berkeley and went to Berkeley schools.\n\"I take a really strong approach to using data, and reality-based information,\" he said.\nHarrison, 58, said what sets her apart is \"a sense of empathy for the people who are here today,\" adding: \"It's not all about the big ideas.\"\nThe candidates also spoke briefly about the closure of Alta Bates hospital.\nHarrison said she would like the city to approve a zoning overlay that would limit the types of uses on site.\n\"Alta Bates is not yet closing,\" she said. \"We cannot allow this hospital to leave.\"\nGould said he is not in favor of the overlay because that could open the city up to a lawsuit.\n\"I don't think the answer is necessarily picking a fight with Sutter,\" Gould said, adding that a different medical organization might be a better fit for Berkeley in the end anyway. He said, he does, however, want to see the city with robust medical services.\nHarrison said she is in favor of the \"deep green\" building standards put forward by Mayor Jesse Arreguin and District 5 Councilwoman Sophie Hahn. She said the city must focus on environmental growth, and add more staff to help with those issues.\n\"This is not a challenge we can put off. Our planet is dying,\" she said.\nShe said she would not support the sidewalk ordinances approved by council last year, and that the city needs to help the homeless on a case-by-case basis: \"I want to separate problematic street behavior from homelessness,\" she said, adding that the city already has adequate rules on the books to address any problems that occur. She also made a point to say she does not support \"early morning raids\" on homeless camps.\nGould said his focus would be to \"make sure our public services are welcoming and accessible to everybody,\" as far as parks, sidewalks and other public spaces. Everybody should follow the same rules, he said, noting that he can't set up a tent on public land, and others shouldn't be able to either.\nLast week, the Progressive Student Association -- founded in 2015 as \"UC Berkeley Students for Bernie Sanders\" -- filed a complaint with the city alleging campaign violations on Gould's part. They said he failed to include \"Ben Gould for Council 2017\" on electronic advertisements, which is required by law. The group said Gould also failed, during his 2016 mayoral run, to list himself among donors on his campaign materials: \"Violating either one of these is a disqualifiable offenses [sic] (including a prohibition on running for four years) under the law.\"\nGould replied that he is \"proud to be running an all-volunteer grassroots campaign, supported by over 60 small donors and hundreds of District 4 residents,\" adding, \"If my campaign made any mistake, it was in good faith, and we will work diligently with the Fair Campaign Political Practices Commission to address it.\"\nHe called the demand that he be disqualified from the race \"a shocking departure from progressive principles\": \"Berkeley's election laws are intended to encourage democratic participation by everyday people -- not suppress it. I'm appalled that the Progressive Student Alliance would seek to disenfranchise the hundreds of Berkeley neighbors that support my vision by attempting to bully a fellow progressive student out of the race.\"\n\n\n\n\nIn January, Gould received about $4,000 contributions from 31 people, including former West Berkeley Councilman Darryl Moore, former Berkeley Councilman Gordon Wozniak, and sitting North Berkeley Councilwoman Susan Wengraf. He'd already collected about $8,500 in donations, in 2016, from more than 30 people, including sitting Berkeley Councilwoman Lori Droste. Some donors gave to the campaign in both 2016 and 2017. Nearly $3,000 of his 2016 fundraising came through an allocation from his 2016 mayoral campaign coffer.\nHarrison -- outpacing Gould on the fundraising front by a factor of nearly 2 -- raised about $15,400 in contributions last year from about 100 people, and another $7,000 from 54 or so people in 2017, as of Jan. 21. Many names on her donor list are frequent public speakers at city hearings related to development. They also include Berkeley Councilwoman Sophie Hahn, former Oakland Mayor Jean Quan, former Berkeley mayoral candidate and current advisor to the mayor Jacquelyn McCormick, recent council hopeful Fred Dodsworth, and Austene Hall, who has fought development hard in Berkeley on numerous occasions, including with the failed 2014 Measure R initiative focused on downtown development, which Hall helped craft alongside Hahn and Mayor Arreguin.\nSee complete endorsement information for both candidates on their websites, which appear at the bottom of this story. According to a Dec. 8 council item, the special election is set to cost $158,500. Conducting the election by mail reduces the cost by 40%, according to the council item.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about Ben Gould and Kate Harrison on their websites.

Photo: Frances DinkelspielAt 6:15 a.m. on Jan. 31, the McDonald's at the intersection of University and Shattuck avenues in downtown Berkeley was busy. A small line of people stood at the counter to order coffee, Egg McMuffins and other early-morning fare. But the real action was at the tables spread throughout the recently modernized fast-food outlet.\nAt one table, two men who looked to be in their 20s talked and greeted people as they passed by. One table over, another youngish man in a black plaid coat lay splayed out on a padded bench, fast asleep. His feet jutted out over the bench into the aisle. Not far from him, a young couple, clearly in love, hugged one another closely as they drank from white paper cups.\nMost of the 19 people gathered in McDonald's that early Tuesday morning were homeless. And this reporter had come there with two others to count them as part of Alameda County's 2017 homeless Point-in-Time census and survey. The homeless count, conducted every two years, is required by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and determines the amount of money the government hands out for homeless services. Berkeley currently receives about $4.8 million from the government for transitional and permanent housing for homeless individuals, according to figures provided by the city.\nCheck out Berkeleyside's Homeless Fact Sheet.\"Counting the number of people sleeping outdoors, in shelters or in transitional housing is critical to helping us understand the size and scope of homelessness in Berkeley,\" Paul Buddenhagen, the director of Berkeley's Health, Housing & Community Services said in a statement.\n\nVolunteers conducting the last survey, in January 2015, determined there were an estimated 834 homeless people in Berkeley. That was a 23% increase from the previous count in 2009. Some homeless service providers, and the homeless themselves, have said that number is too low and have estimated there are about 1,200 homeless people in Berkeley. Alameda County had 4,040 homeless individuals in 2015.\nOne of the homeless people, in Ohlone Park, included in the Alameda County count on Jan. 31. Photo: Frances DinkelspielIn 2015, however, Alameda County and its various cities did not try and do an actual count of the homeless. Instead, volunteers counted those sleeping outside in sample areas and the results were used to calculate final figures.\nBut the group running the 2017 count decided to change tactics, in part because an actual count might result in more funds for the county than a projected account. So EveryOneHome, the organization overseeing the count, put out a call for volunteers. More than 500 people showed up in various locations around the county on Jan. 31. Some were community members and some were guides for those volunteers -- generally, people who were homeless or who had previously experienced homelessness. They were paid $15 an hour for their services.\nPeople gathered around 5:00 a.m. Jan. 31 outside Berkeley's central library to volunteer in the survey of those experiencing homelessness. Photo: Frances DinkelspielI arrived at the Central Branch of the Berkeley Public Library promptly at 5 a.m. to participate in the count. A group of us stood in front of the locked glass doors at the main entrance on Kittredge Street until we figured out we had to enter through a back door on Bancroft.\nBy 5:10 a.m. there were about 60 people gathered in the library community room, many sipping cups of coffee provided by EveryOneHome. The organizers told us we were going to be divided into groups of three or four and sent to a small area of Berkeley. We would be given a map of a neighborhood, as well as a survey and clipboard. Our task was to roam the streets, peek into doorways and alleyways and peer behind bushes and trees to see if we could spot anyone who appeared not to have housing. We were supposed to note people's ages and sex, but not their race.\nEveryOneHome uses the federal definition of homelessness in deciding who to count: \"homeless individuals and families who stay in a place not ordinarily used for sleeping,\" such as a \"car, park, abandoned building, bus or train station, airport, or camping ground.\"\nBut there were some ground rules which seemed to complicate the count. Volunteers were not supposed to talk to the people they encountered. If they spotted a tent or a car that appeared occupied, volunteers couldn't call out hello and ask directly how many people were inside. So guesswork is part of the count. EveryOneHome tries to compensate for this uncertainty by conducting in-depth follow-up interviews after the count is finished\nI was teamed up with City Councilwoman Sophie Hahn (City Councilwoman Lori Droste was also a volunteer) and Moe Wright, a board member of EveryOne Home. Wright, a principle at BBI Construction and a Berkeley resident, had been on two previous counts.\nSophie, Moe, and I were assigned a broad swath north of University Avenue roughly bordered by Spruce Street and MLK. We left the library in the dark and parked near campus. We figured most of those sleeping outside would be clustered along the main arterials in the downtown. We started by the building that once held Ace Hardware.\nNot surprisingly, there were many people sleeping in the doorways along that stretch of University. Many of the buildings are currently unoccupied as they are slated to become part of a modern apartment complex called Acheson Commons. We immediately saw a group of three men huddled together in a doorway in one of the buildings. They were awake and sitting up. The two doorways next to them were completely covered by cardboard contraptions set up to provide privacy for those sleeping behind the makeshift walls. We couldn't see behind the walls so we broke one of the rules: we asked the men who were awake how many \"neighbors\" they had.\nMoe Wright, board member of EveryOneHome, and City Councilwoman Sophie Hahn, confer on what to write down on the homeless survey. Photo: Frances DinkelspielHahn had walked numerous precincts when she ran for the District 5 City Council seat in the fall and had the best grasp on how to make sure we covered every nook and cranny. She was also the fastest walker. We generally split up, with two people walking down one side of the street and one on the other, trying to keep one another in sight.\nIn three hours, we counted 54 people who were experiencing homeless. Most of them were sleeping in spots one might expect: in Ohlone Park, along University, Martin Luther King, and Miliva. On one occasion, when we wandered into an alley off of Walnut Street, it was too dark to see so we had to use the flashlights on our cellphones.\nInterestingly, we didn't find anyone sleeping on property belonging to the University of California. We didn't see anyone in the doorways of private homes, either. Most of those sleeping outside were on city-owned land or in storefronts.\nIt wasn't always easy to know who was homeless or who was just up early for work. We peered into a coffee shop on the corner of Shattuck and Hearst around 6:30 a.m. and saw a neatly dressed woman sitting at a table drinking a cup of coffee. She had some packages at her feet but there was no particular indication that she didn't have permanent shelter. But then we spotted her about an hour later walking west on Hearst toward Milvia, burdened by a backpack and some plastic bags. Seeing her with so much stuff at such an early hour changed our assessment of her living situation. In our mind, she was homeless.\nWe also saw a young man sitting in a doorway of an apartment building on Milvia. He was playing his guitar and singing; he could have just been an early riser. We broke the rules then, too, and asked if had a place to sleep. He said he lived on the streets. Then he asked for a dollar.\nMany homeless people gather at the McDonald's on University Avenue. Photo: Frances DinkelspielOur walking tour led us past McDonald's again and we went inside for a second time, this time fairly close to 8 a.m. The man who had been sleeping on a padded bench was now awake, but almost everyone we had spotted two hours earlier had left, to be replaced by another set of homeless people.\nOn the way out, I stopped to talk to a man who said he had once been an engineer at UC Berkeley but he had been living on the street for 19 years. He said his name was John Simone and he was 59 but he preferred to be called Red Wolf Moonkiller in acknowledgment of his Lakota roots. He wanted me to hear a song he had written about the callousness of the government and how it spent funds on buildings rather than people. It was quite good.\nThe result of the survey will be available in the summer.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Berkeley volunteers count the city's homeless population", "Tags": "['Berkeley Homeless Project', 'Berkeley homelessness']", "Sections": "['City', 'City']", "Natural Language Location": "University and Shattuck", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.872165", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "247402", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.268391", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/06/berkeley-volunteers-count-citys-homeless-population/", "Author": "Frances Dinkelspiel", "Date": "2017-02-06T13:31:32-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "The Berkeley Police chief has said he did not want a repeat of the 2014 Black Lives Matter protests (shown above), where police used tear gas to clear Telegraph Avenue and sparked extensive public outcry.

That night, BPD gave many dispersal orders, which the department said -- it later realized -- only served in the end to make the crowd larger. Police ultimately used an estimated 50 tear gas grenades and \"blast rounds\" to clear Telegraph Avenue, and some people reported being struck and clubbed by police at different times throughout the night.\nLast week, a preliminary settlement was reached between the city and seven plaintiffs in a civil rights lawsuit that challenged how police responded Dec. 6, 2014. According to some reports, the city has agreed to a payment of $125,000, as well as policy changes that would require officers to document force better, and work toward equipping officers with body cameras. (A Berkeleyside story is forthcoming.)\nAfter last week's demonstrations, sparked by a campus visit by conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, Interim Berkeley Police Chief Andrew Greenwood said in a memo to city officials that the lessons learned in 2014 absolutely played a role in decision-making Wednesday night.\n\nIn the hours and days following Wednesday night's protests, many -- particularly outside the Bay Area -- decried the police response on campus and in the city of Berkeley. Two entirely separate law enforcement agencies handle those jurisdictions: the University of California Police Department, a statewide agency, handles security on university property including campus, and the Berkeley Police Department, which deals with the rest of the city.\nBerkeleyside had an in-depth conversation Friday with UCPD Police Chief Margo Bennett about how she handled Wednesday's demonstrations. And Berkeleyside has spoken with BPD about why the agency made no arrests and did little to intervene in intensive vandalism to more than a dozen Berkeley businesses. But, to this point, Berkeleyside had not heard from the BPD chief himself.\nChief Greenwood sent a 2-page memo to Berkeley City Manager Dee Williams-Ridley on Friday outlining his thinking Wednesday night during what he called the \"Feb. 1 riot.\" Berkeleyside has obtained a copy of that memo from the city.\n\"Elements of the crowd were actively looking for a conflict with our officers\"\nInterim Berkeley Police Chief Andrew Greenwood (right) at a community meeting in January. Photo: Emilie RagusoGreenwood told the city manager that the department's actions Wednesday night \"were informed significantly by our experience in the December 2014 riots.\" The department's thinking and approach \"has significantly evolved\" since those events, he said, and new training and policies have been put in place.\nThe department's focus during riots, he said, is life safety: \"I think this is not only in keeping with the values of our community, but with the best-informed practices of Law Enforcement across the country, in a time where community trust in our actions is absolutely essential.\"\nHe described crowd management as \"a complex challenge\" for law enforcement.\n\"A large, leaderless crowd may appear to stand together on one hand to exercise their 1st amendment rights to assemble, and to speak freely, yet have different motives and intents throughout the course of a given demonstration. When such a crowd includes within it a faction of armed people intent on committing violence, as happened Wednesday night, safeguarding the community's safety becomes particularly challenging.\"\nGreenwood said he watched live-stream coverage of the protest on Sproul Plaza last week, as it was unfolding, and saw many who were peaceful, \"standing, singing, dancing, chanting, watching, playing music, and generally boisterously expressing their views.\" But they weren't the only ones.\n\"Into this crowd came a large group of armed, masked individuals, often referred to as 'black bloc' anarchists, who brought projectiles, shields, explosive fireworks and other weapons. In a coordinated effort, this group carried out an organized, focused attack on UC Police, barricades and campus property. This action prompted UC officials to cancel the speaking engagement.\"\n\"Black bloc\" anarchists at the Milo protest at UC Berkeley. Photo: Pete RososEventually, after demonstrating on campus, the crowd moved into city streets and BPD became involved. BPD has said it initially assigned 12 officers to oversee the demonstration and provide traffic control. When tensions rose, the department pulled officers from patrol to help out, for a total of about 20 officers on protest duty.\nGreenwood said BPD monitored the crowd continually. One BPD staffer was in the UCPD command post all night, and police also were watching \"open source livestream videos on the internet.\"\nBPD responded to several people who were injured, but exercised caution when it did so, Greenwood told the city manager.\n\"All this was done knowing that placing police officers into a potentially volatile crowd situation could have prompted a focused, sustained violent attack on police, thereby rapidly escalating the risk of harm to all involved -- peaceful protestors, violent actors, residents, businesses and police officers,\" he wrote.\nGreenwood said BPD had to take that stance because it was clear some \"elements of the crowd were actively looking for a conflict with our officers.\" (UC Berkeley Police Chief Margo Bennett has made a similar point.)\n\"In one case where officers came into view, they reported being seen by the crowd, and members of the crowd started to move towards them, even from hundreds of feet away,\" Greenwood wrote.\nCity of Berkeley police officers were staged in the Underhill Garage on Feb. 1 during the Milo protests. Approximately 15 of them were staged as of about 10:20 p.m. Photo: Frances DinkelspielGreenwood said BPD had seen the \"opportunistic rioters\" who attacked UCPD, and who \"were eager to provoke and escalate a police response to an already boisterous and potentially volatile crowd, thereby putting relatively peaceful protesters into harm's way. The black bloc typically uses a peaceful crowd to shield their activities during a police response, and we kept this in mind.\"\nHe wrote that using force \"indiscriminately\" on the crowd \"can harm more people, including protesters who are not breaking the law.\"\nGreenwood said no one has come forward to make an official report to BPD about any crimes or injuries Wednesday night. He asked people who are interested in that to call 510-981-5900 to do so. (UCPD is also attempting to collect these reports.)\nIn the memo, he also thanked Mayor Jesse Arreguin for visiting BPD on Thursday morning to express \"his thanks and support of our folks.\"\nGreenwood continued: \"None of our staff could recall when a Mayor had come by like that, and it meant a lot to our team.\"\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "BPD chief: Lessons learned in 2014 'Black Lives Matter' protests guided us during Milo demonstrations", "Tags": "['Andrew Greenwood', 'Berkeley protests', 'Black Lives Matter protests', 'Donald Trump', 'Public safety', 'Southside Berkeley', 'UC Berkeley', 'UC Berkeley protests']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Crime & Safety', 'Downtown', 'Police', 'Politics', 'Schools', 'UC Berkeley']", "Natural Language Location": "Telegraph Avenue", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.866628", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "247302", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.258705", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/05/berkeley-police-chief-lessons-learned-2014-black-lives-matter-protests-guided-us-milo-demonstrations/", "Author": "Emilie Raguso", "Date": "2017-02-05T16:20:26-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Photo: Pete Rosos\"Our campus has never experienced what it went through on Wednesday,\" UCPD Police Chief Margo Bennett said Friday night, some 48 hours after protesters and police clashed over the planned appearance of right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos on the UC Berkeley campus. \nSee complete coverage of the Berkeley protestsAn estimated 1,500 people took part in demonstrations against Yiannopoulos that night, with perhaps 100-200 of them using what UC Berkeley has described as \"paramilitary tactics, including hurling Molotov cocktails, setting fires, throwing fireworks at police, pushing barricades into windows and damaging campus and city property.\"\nIn the hours and days following Wednesday night's protests, many -- particularly outside the Bay Area -- have decried the police response, both on campus and in the city of Berkeley.

In the city, the costs of property damage and clean-up efforts have not been tallied.\nOn campus, UC Berkeley has estimated the damage from Wednesday night's protests will cost $100,000 to fix. UCPD made just one arrest that night, of a 19-year-old man who failed to leave the area of the protests despite repeated dispersal orders. Some have expressed anger that UCPD did not do more to help injured people who were attacked on campus as the initially peaceful demonstration on Sproul Plaza took a violent turn when \"black bloc\" members of the crowd reportedly threw Molotov cocktails and bricks, shattered glass, set fires and more.\nA woman named Katrina, who was interviewed by radio host Stefan Molyneux, said she and her husband were left with serious injuries when the crowd turned on them. She was pepper-sprayed, she said, and left with a concussion. When she tried to get help from campus police, who had taken a position inside a building, she said, they would not let her inside.

But she said police at times have to make tough calls to minimize the potential for violence overall.\n\"In situations like that, we understand that if we go out and we engage -- with the level of force and the presence of the trained anarchist-style protesters that were present -- it will embolden the protesters and it will escalate the level of violence,\" she said. \"And our officers exercised, I think, some very tough and extreme restraint.\"\nThe goal Wednesday night, she said, initially was to ensure that the event occurred and that anyone who wanted to express their First Amendment rights could do so. UCPD aimed to protect life, and also to protect property. But hard decisions had to be made in the end.\n\"We prioritize the protecting of life higher than everything else,\" she said. \"Some broken windows, we can accept. The fact that no one was seriously injured is a blessing when that level of violence was occurring.\"\nBennett said first-responders rescued and gave medical aid to four people. Three of them had been pepper-sprayed by other protesters. One person had been assaulted. Bennett said none of those people wanted to make police reports, however. All four received first aid at the scene and then left on their own.\nRegarding the pepper spray, she noted, it has reportedly been used by members of the crowd on police at other protests in Berkeley in Oakland, but never on campus.\n\"This was part of the black bloc that used pepper spray,\" she said.\nBennett said she heard about several other people, \"wandering injured,\" who had been helped by the Berkeley Fire Department and Paramedics Plus ambulance service, but all of them declined transport to the hospital.\nThe chief also said it was not clear Wednesday night who in the crowd was being attacked, whether it was people who had come to see Milo, or others: \"We don't have any way of knowing. It appears to be random in the crowd, and the crowd was mixed together.\" UCPD has asked anyone who was injured to contact the department, at 510-642-6760, so it can complete its investigation and make sure appropriate services are offered.\nAs for injuries to officers, one reported suffering some hearing loss after an M-80 landed right beside him. Bennett said she wasn't sure if that injury would be temporary or permanent.\nShe described the demonstrators who used violent tactics as a \"well-trained paramilitary style group,\" adding: \"They were all dressed alike. They brought weapons with them. Their presence at a public event on campus is not something we've experienced before.\"\nThe police line on campus shortly after 10 p.m. Wednesday. Photo: Frances DinkelspielBennett declined to state how many officers UCPD had on campus, but said nine of the 10 University of California campuses sent officers to help. UCPD also called the Alameda County sheriff's office for what's known as \"mutual aid,\" and officers from around the county, including Oakland, responded to help. But Bennett said she could not say how many officers came from which agencies because those are tactical details that could compromise security if shared.\nDespite widespread reports online about what was called a \"stand down order\" by police in Berkeley, Bennett said that never happened. In fact, that isn't a law enforcement term, she said.\n\"I don't know what a 'stand down' order is,\" she said. \"We did not tell anyone to stand down. What we did tell officers to do was: 'Hold your post.'\"\nWhen rocks, M-80s, flares and Molotov cocktails started flying, she said, \"we had [officers] pull back into the building because our job was going to be to hold the building. That's where our post was,\" inside the Pauley Ballroom in the Martin Luther King Jr. Student Union where the Milo event was slated to have taken place.\nShe said UCPD grenadiers did shoot \"less-lethal munitions,\" including pepper balls and paint balls, to mark offenders for possible arrest later, and to keep demonstrators away from the building. Bennett said that approach ultimately did keep people at bay, and also interrupted protester assaults on other members of the crowd.\nAll UCPD officers who used force, she said, would be required to document it as per longstanding department policy. Bennett said a special report would be completed about the demonstrations, but she did not know whether or in what form it might become publicly available.\nUCPD took a position inside the student union building Feb., 1.

Dan Mogulof, a university spokesman, is on the right and Stephen Sutton, the interim vice chancellor for student affairs, is on the left. Photo: Frances DinkelspielSome have also questioned why UCPD gave so many dispersal orders to the crowd but did not act right away. Bennett said the law does not require immediate action following dispersal orders, and that UCPD was waiting for mutual aid to arrive from other law enforcement agencies so that it was in a position to act.\n\"We waited until we were ready,\" she said.\nBennett said the public needs to know that dispersal orders are not given lightly, and should be obeyed.\n\"When you hear it, you should know exactly what it means,\" said Bennett. \"And what it means is, you need to leave, and we will take action if you don't.\"\nOne of the frustrations of the night for police, she added, was that people unaware of the protests and violence were wandering around campus and through the area of the demonstrations, potentially putting themselves at risk. UCPD put out a \"shelter-in-place\" order at about 6:15 p.m. But not everyone got it. Officers on the scene tried to advise pedestrians about the situation, but it didn't always work.\n\"We're trying to explain, it's not safe for you to go there,\" she said, \"and they keep walking.\"\nBennett said, as far as she could recall, Wednesday evening's \"shelter in place\" advisory was the first to go out campus-wide since perhaps 2011. As a result, she said, not everyone may be familiar with exactly what it means or how important it is to take heed. She compared it to the \"stop, drop and roll\" fire safety advice many learn as children, and said, these days, everyone needs to have a similar immediate and reflexive response to \"shelter in place.\"\n\"This is really the first time where we've had an incident where it was dangerous for people to come out,\" she said, continuing: \"It was appropriate to use that caution.\"\nBennett said the university already does try to educate the campus community about what \"shelter in place\" means, but that more drills and presentations are likely in the works \"to help ingrain that into our institution.... to expose them to this, and put it out there frequently. Hopefully it'll stick.\"\nProtesters gathered at Sproul Plaza at UC Berkeley on February, 1 2017 to protest an event being held by the Berkeley College Republicans featuring \"alt-right\" (white nationalist, anti-trans, anti-immigrant, etc) media personality Milo Yiannopoulos. Things were peaceful and empowering until a small group of Black Bloc protestors began tearing down barriers, shooting fireworks at police, and setting things on fire. Photo: Dan LurieBoth UCPD and BPD used the Nixle system Wednesday to put out safety alerts. The system offers email and text alerts to anyone who signs up. BPD sent out 13 advisories to the community to keep them informed about developments. UCPD sent out four alerts.\nBut some of those alerts were delayed to campus affiliates, Bennett said. UCPD actually put out a follow-up Nixle alert at about 5:15 p.m. Thursday -- nearly 24 hours after the initial alert -- to make it clear to people that the shelter-in-place warning had been lifted.\n\"Please be advised that as of 3am on Thursday February 2nd, there have been no more reports of riot activity on, or near the UC Berkeley campus and a Shelter-In-Place order is NO LONGER in effect,\" the alert read.\nIt's not the first time there's been a delay either. Earlier this year, when police were looking for a UC Berkeley student they said stabbed one woman and killed another, alerts to the community came late and were delayed to many.\nBennett confirmed to Berkeleyside that there had been a delay as far as some of the emails that went out Wednesday to the campus community, but said UC Berkeley is \"working with the vendor to discover what happened.\"\nTime will tell exactly when UC Berkeley will have to face a similar challenge again. But there's no reason to think it won't.\nThe East Bay Times reported Saturday afternoon that Milo hopes to return to the Bay Area to speak within the next few months, \"to give the speech I was prevented from delivering,\" he wrote on Facebook.\nMore than 34,000 people liked the post, which had been shared nearly 1,000 times as of publication time.\nMilo said, on Facebook, he wants to come back to Berkeley.UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof told the East Bay Times, however, he'd heard nothing from student groups to indicate that appearance is slated for the Cal campus.\nBennett said, in the future, if controversial events are planned on campus, UCPD will be involved with hosts to work to ensure those events are safe. She declined to go into detail about what might have been done differently Wednesday, but said her agency will learn from the past as it plans for the future.\n\"We will make changes and adapt as we move forward,\" Bennett said.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "UCPD chief at Berkeley: 'Crowd control situations are different'", "Tags": "['Berkeley protests', 'Donald Trump', 'Public safety', 'Southside Berkeley', 'UC Berkeley', 'UC Berkeley protests']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Crime & Safety', 'Downtown', 'Police', 'Politics', 'Schools', 'UC Berkeley']", "Natural Language Location": "UC Berkeley", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.869861", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "247256", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.258765", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/04/ucpd-chief-berkeley-crowd-control-situations-different/", "Author": "Emilie Raguso", "Date": "2017-02-04T16:43:16-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Milo protesters in Berkeley on Feb. 1, 2017.

The building was originally a bowling alley; it then became the original Berkeley Bowl Market and for the next fifteen years housed the Any Mountain sporting goods store. 2777 Shattuck is right where Adeline and Shattuck merge into one street. It's a busy and confusing intersection.\nMore than 200 South Shattuck neighbors have spent the last two years trying to fight Berkeley Honda's plan to build the new dealership and 14 bay repair shop in this location. There is no neighborhood group that I know of that is in favor of having a dealership in that already congested location. In fact, it is in violation of Berkeley land use policies and the Berkeley Municipal Code. It also disregards the plans for an Adeline Corridor that would link Berkeley and Oakland via pedestrian walkways, bike lanes, and open spaces.\nOpposition to this project is not an anti- development stance as some might portray it. Some type of commercial and/or residential complex will go into this desirable location that already houses two wonderful restaurants, Kirala, and Stonehenge.\n With all the new housing being built on South Shattuck, there will be hundreds of new residents in South Berkeley. There will be a growing need for services and businesses that enhance the area and help make it an attractive, and safe place to live. We have hopes that the new mayor and city council will move us towards a greener and more sustainable downtown. If the city of Berkeley is to allow so many new large residential buildings, it needs to ensure that AC transit can still service it's routes, that children can continue to walk to school, and that dangerous traffic problems be addressed not created. Putting an auto dealership and repair shop in this location disregards all of these legitimate concerns\nThis project conflicts with existing land use policies. Auto servicing and repair is not allowed in locations that have not previously been used for that purpose. Honda has been able to finesse this by characterizing the service and repair as ancillary (secondary) to their main business of sales, however the plans for a 14 bay repair shop makes that claim dubious. Plans for parking and parts deliveries are equally questionable, as it includes their exclusive use of a public right of way.\nLastly, there is the issue that has become Honda's (and some council members) most repeated objection to our appeal which is that denying this project in this location, is to deny union jobs and tax revenue. Loss of union jobs and tax revenue is a real concern, throughout the city of Berkeley. However by ignoring all the legal, zoning, and safety concerns that make this project untenable is to unfairly scapegoat this appeal on behalf of citywide issues. Neighborhood opposition to this project is a valid response to a land uses violation that will impact everyone whether they live nearby or are just passing through.

Photo: Dan LurieBy Carlo David\nA day after violent protestors clashed with university police and damaged campus properties, leading to the cancellation of Milo Yiannopoulos' event, continuing tensions loomed over the UC Berkeley community.\nReturning to normalcy on campus in the aftermath of a violent protest was not easy. For some, it was even uncomfortable.\nOn Sproul Plaza, right below the Pauley Ballroom, where Yiannopoulos was slated to speak Wednesday night before violent protests prompted UC to cancel his talk, there was a long line of students Thursday getting their morning dose of caffeine. Every couch was occupied and every table was filled with stacks of books and laptops.\n\nThe silence was almost deafening.\nOutside, ashes from a generator that angry demonstrators set on fire the night before could still be seen on the ground. Smashed and broken windows had been replaced with wooden panels. One tree had been badly singed. Campus officials have estimated the damage to be around $100,000.\nYet Sproul Plaza was cleaner than one might expect after such a destructive protest, in part because a group of students had spontaneously organized a brigade, through Facebook, to clean up the plaza. They arrived before dawn (university clean-up crews were already at work) with brooms, dust pans, trash bags and gloves to try to restore order, and later moved over to Telegraph Avenue, too,\n\"We started at Sproul Plaza around 5 a.m., primarily focusing on picking up trash and stacking extra barricades off to the side,\" Tanwei Chen, a second-year energy engineering major, told the news site, The Tab. \"Once the plaza was cleared enough to power-wash, some volunteers left to rest or attend class. A smaller group went along Telegraph then Shattuck. Though we picked up some trash, we spent most of our effort on picking up broken glass.\"\nClubs and organization had lined up their usual array of tables on Sproul, including the Berkeley College Republicans, whose table was draped with an American flag, hoping to recruit interested parties. There were also the regular collection of campus outsiders preaching about a myriad of things - socialism, the Second Coming, or the present administration's plan to subvert democracy.\nBut the facade showed several cracks.\nAround 11:40 a.m., Jack Palkovic, a Cal student and member of the College Republicans, was being interviewed by KTVU at the intersection of Telegraph and Bancroft when two men in a car pulled over. They jumped out and tried to take off Palkovic's red Trump hat, according to the television station. UCPD arrested two men, who were not affiliated with the university. Two men were arrested on suspicion of battery, grand theft and criminal threats, according to police.\nThen around 2 p.m., a spontaneous debate ensued between a self-identified Trump supporter and an outsider, who was among those who showed up Wednesday night, hoping to shut down Yiannopoulos. \"This is a [expletive] odious administration!\"\nThe animosity reverberated across campus such that even a hoard of students rushing out from lecture halls would not drown them out.\nProtesters gathered at Sproul Plaza at UC Berkeley on Feb. 1 to protest an event being held by the Berkeley College Republicans featuring \"alt-right\" (white nationalist, anti-trans, anti-immigrant, etc) media personality Milo Yiannopoulos. Things were peaceful and empowering until a small group of Black Bloc protesters began tearing down barriers, shooting fireworks at police, and setting things on fire. Photo: Dan LurieIn a lot of ways, the exchange was telling of a campus divided over whether Wednesday night's events were justified or not.\nMatthew Verish, a third-year mathematics undergraduate, disagreed with the level of destruction caused by a small portion of the protesters.\n\"How can an anti-fascist organization resort to violent means, just because it does not agree with [Yiannopoulos]?\" he said, a note of exasperation in his voice. \"You just cannot have a debate on free speech when you are intent on censoring others.\"\nAmong Berkeley College Republicans, the idea of censorship pales compared to the alleged harassment, both physical and verbal, they have had to deal with as an outlier in a progressive bastion.\n\"We were followed by thugs [Wednesday night] on our way home, as soon as UCPD announced the event had been canceled,\" said BCR representative Troy Worden. \"I am not just sure how we move forward from this, given the kind of treatment our members have been receiving from both outsiders and students.\"\nHowever, attendance at the group's weekly meeting surged after the protests, with a \"line out the door,\" to get into the meeting room, according to KTVU.\nUC Berkeley says about 150 \"masked individuals with paramilitary tactics\" hurled Molotov cocktails, set fires, shot fireworks at police and damaged property Wednesday night. Photo: Ted FriedmanIt appears as though the campus is polarized over the subject of responsibility for Wednesday night's turn of events. Some lamented vicious acts and paramilitary tactics, employed by masked agitators, as university spokesman Dan Mogulof described them. Others point to the administration's decision to allow the event to go on despite wide opposition, including from some members of the faculty. (See the letter here).\nIf there is any room for common ground, it would be that the issues at the heart of the protests -- immigration, women's rights, rape culture, LGBTQ -- have been drowned out by dominant portrayals of Wednesday's events as a war zone between police officers and violent protestors. This was disheartening to those who had hoped to engage peacefully.\nThe somber mood inside one of the university's study spaces is a proof of that.\nOn what was otherwise a busy day, the room was uncharacteristically empty. A campus staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, expressed dismay toward the administration while pointing out the impact Yiannopolous' presence had created, particularly among LGBTQ students.\n\"This goes beyond what happened last night,\" he said. \"Since the election, we have seen an upsurge in the number of students seeking services.

Photo: Citizen reporterFollowing Wednesday night's demonstrations in Berkeley, sparked by a campus visit by conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, the Berkeley Police Department reported no arrests, two to three injuries, and damage to about 15 businesses.\nTwo of the injured people were beaten and pepper-sprayed by others in the crowd, authorities said.\nBPD used no force at any point in the evening, said Officer Byron White, a Berkeley Police Department spokesman.\nThe University of California Police Department -- a completely separate law enforcement agency -- has not responded directly to questions regarding injuries, damage, use of force or arrests. The university, which was responsible for the event, has provided a statement condemning violent tactics aimed to shut down free speech and published its own overview of the impacts of the demonstration.\n\nRead more about UC Berkeley protestsThe lack of arrests or apparent police response in the city angered many online, who asked: Where were the police as hundreds of protesters marched through city streets lighting fires and causing some of the most extensive property damage Berkeley has seen during a demonstration.\nAuthorities have said it was 100-200 people, out of a crowd numbering 1,000 or more, who were responsible for the violence and non-peaceful aspects of the protest. In response to the demonstration, UCPD issued a shelter-in-place advisory on campus that lasted for many hours. Authorities urged everyone to avoid the area of Telegraph and Bancroft, and said they might have to use tear gas to disperse the crowd. Ultimately, it didn't come to that.\n\nWhite said BPD had signed up 12 officers to focus on protest activities Wednesday night in addition to the city's regular patrol. That's because the event was happening on the UC Berkeley campus, which has its own police force and access to additional resources from other law enforcement agencies through mutual aid agreements.\nBPD began getting involved Wednesday shortly after 5 p.m., however, as it worked to help with traffic control around Telegraph Avenue in the neighborhood south of the UC Berkeley campus, where more than 1,000 people had gathered to protest. It quickly became clear, as demonstrators shot commercial-grade fireworks at campus police and smashed windows at the student union, that it was going to be a long night.\nAs \"things began to spiral,\" White said, people were taking to the streets and BPD was trying to help get motorists out of the area safely, while blocking streets for traffic control to help keep the demonstration safe.\nAfter UC Berkeley abruptly canceled the Yiannopoulos around 6 p.m., the demonstration moved into Berkeley streets and through downtown. BPD ultimately pulled in another 8-10 officers from its patrol teams to help handle the demonstration, for a total of about 20 BPD officers handling the chaos that ensued.\n\n\nFire at Wells Fargo #milo @berkeleyside pic.twitter.com/oDlqu3px4R\n-- Kevin Kunze (@KunzeFilms) February 2, 2017\n\nWhite said it was clear to police that most members of the crowd were peaceful. But, with so few resources, it was difficult to deal safely with those who weren't, he said.\n\"How do you address those disrupting individuals, because they're not separate,\" he said. \"They're intermingled.\"\nThroughout the night, BPD used the Nixle system to send out 13 advisories to the community to keep them informed about developments. The alert system offers email and text alerts to anyone who signs up. UCPD also used Nixle, but only sent out four alerts.\nBecause of its limited number of officers, BPD focused on responding to injury reports, White said. He noted that there may have been additional injuries, but said the department isn't able to handle calls that don't come in to dispatch. BPD had no injuries to officers. And it did not handle injuries that may have occurred on campus, which is under UCPD's jurisdiction.\n\"Whenever we got a report of somebody hurt or injured, we tried to provide protection for fire department personnel to get to the injured person,\" White said. \"It was quite an active crowd.\"\nOne individual was punched and pepper-sprayed at Addison and Milvia streets, but he was not interested in prosecution, White said. Another person said he was on Shattuck Avenue downtown filming when a group of people began to hit him with sticks and fists, and then pepper-sprayed him.\n\"Right before that, they said, 'No filming, no pictures,'\" White said. There was some indication a third person may have been injured but police got no further information about it.\nThere was also a report -- and video captured by a San Francisco Chronicle reporter and many others -- of a motorist driving through the crowd and hitting someone. But no victims ever came forward. White said the driver did call BPD later and provide his contact information. Absent any complaint, White said, there is not a crime.\nProperty damage in downtown Berkeley after the Milo event was canceled.

The damage included spray paint and graffiti, broken windows and fires being set inside buildings. But any tallies about repair costs, he said, would have to come from insurance companies.\nGlass was shattered and ATMS were vandalized at a number of Berkeley banks, including Mechanics Bank, Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Starbucks Coffee also had windows smashed, and some trash fires were set around downtown.\nAfter the demonstrators marched back onto the UC Berkeley campus, around 10:30 p.m., White said Berkeley officers responded to the downtown businesses that were boarding up their broken windows to help keep them safe.\nWhite said, as a small- to medium-sized department, BPD did the best it could with the resources it had available. BPD also collected surveillance footage and other evidence so investigators can follow up on the vandalism and other property crimes that took place.\nHe said he had heard the frustration from people who felt BPD had not done enough to keep order. But he said, due to the nature of the crowd, BPD had done its best. He said there had been numerous reports about members of the crowd who were equipped with aluminum bats and improvised shields, fireworks they were shooting at officers, and bricks and other objects they were throwing at police in coordinated efforts.\n\"How are 20 cops going to address a crowd of upward of 1,000 people, especially knowing that it's only a fraction of those people who are the most disruptive?\" he said. \"Protection of life was our No. 1 focus.\"\nATMS were boarded up after vandalism Wednesday night following the Mila cancellation. Photo: Frances DinkelspielOn Thursday, downtown Berkeley, which suffered the brunt of the damage, was the scene of boarded-up doors and windows, and workmen repairing busted ATM machines. Customers who wanted to patronize Wells Fargo couldn't walk though the front door but had to use a back entrance because the glass doors had been smashed.\nAll of the bank's ATM machines had been covered with graffiti and smashed. Most of the machines were not seriously damaged and were quickly repaired, said one bank employee who did not want to give his name.\nShortly after the protest on Sproul, a group of UC Berkeley students put up a Facebook event page called \"Clean Up Berkeley.\"\n\"The violent protests that took place Wednesday night do not represent UC Berkeley,\" read the page. \"Let's come together to clean our neighborhood and campus and show everyone what Cal is about. Bring trash bags, gloves, dust pans, brooms, and your friends!\" More than 1,000 said they were interested in going and more than 500 signed up to help.\nAnd they did help.\n\"Berkeley students showed up at 5 am in the rain this morning to clean up the plaza and nearby city streets,\" said Christine Shaff, a university spokeswoman. \"That's the story that should be told.\"\nPost-protest, Cal students pick up litter on Telegraph, taking care of their street.

They also praised small groups of Berkeley students who organized themselves to begin cleaning up debris.\nUCPD has launched an investigation of last night's riotous actions, instigated by some 150 masked individuals with paramilitary tactics, including hurling Molotov cocktails, setting fires, throwing fireworks at police, pushing barricades into windows and damaging campus and city property.\n\n\"The violence was an attack on our fundamental values, which are maintaining and nurturing open inquiry and an inclusive, civil society -- the bedrock of a genuinely democratic nation,\" said Chancellor Nicholas Dirks. \"We are now, and will remain in the future, completely committed to free speech not only as a vital component of our campus identity but as essential to our educational mission.\"\nHe added, \"We appreciate the efforts of our police and Student Affairs staff to protect the rights of both speaker and protesters and their commitment to public safety and minimizing injuries.\"\nSgt. Sabrina Reich, UCPD public information officer, said campus police made one arrest last night of a non-student, on charges of failure to disperse. Officers made several dispersal announcements to the crowd assembled outside the Martin Luther King Jr. Student Union, where Yiannopoulos had been invited speak at 8 p.m. by the Berkeley College Republicans.\nThis morning, two Berkeley College Republicans were attacked while conducting an interview in front of Sproul Hall by two men not affiliated with the campus. The men were arrested by UCPD, which is investigating the incident and did not yet have more details.\nUCPD is compiling video from Wednesday's violence and will be reviewing it to try to identify suspects, Reich added. She encouraged anyone with information or who may have been a victim to contact police at (510) 642-6760.\nWhile police are aware that while some members of the crowd that had gathered outside the student union on Wednesday were hurt, Reich said, \"no one has come forward and made a police report regarding being assaulted or injured.\" UCPD rescued multiple individuals in the crowd who were being attacked, trapped or injured.\nAn early estimate of campus damage is around $100,000, according to campus officials, and includes fixing broken windows at the MLK Student Union, replacing a generator that caught fire and was destroyed, sand-blasting paint off the concrete steps of the student union, cleaning up graffiti and possibly replacing some pavers and trees on Sproul Plaza.

Photo: Pete RososBy Carlo David and Frances Dinkelspiel\nIt was not the evening local Republicans had anticipated.\nSee complete Berkeley protests coverage\nUC Berkeley students, local residents, and people from organizations not affiliated with Cal descended on Sproul Plaza on Wednesday night to protest Milo Yiannopoulos, the conservative provocateur and writer for right-leaning news site Breitbart. The event, hosted by the Berkeley College Republicans, was part of Yiannopolous' \"Dangerous Faggot\" tour of college campuses nationwide, which many have viewed as an effort to sow discord.\nAt 5 p.m., protesters began to assemble outside the ASUC Student Union building, where Yiannopoulos, 32, was slated to speak about \"cultural appropriation\" at 8 p.m. in the Pauley Ballroom. University of California Police had set barricades up around the building's perimeter.\n\nSee Berkeleyside's live blog from Wednesday nightAs organizers entered the building, protestors chanted: \"Shame!\" Others held signs decrying Yiannopolous as a fascist. Jerome Pansa, a Berkeley undergraduate, was among those who showed up early. \"Staying home would be complicit in perpetuating hate speech,\" said Pansa. \"While we should not give him the attention he craves for, so much is at stake.\"\nDespite seeming hostility from protesters toward attendees of the speech, the demonstrations at first remained calm. But not for long.\nAround 5:50 p.m., about 150 men and women in black clothing marched toward the plaza. Many were carrying heavy sticks with black and Communist-themed flags, their faces obscured with bandana masks and hats pulled low on their foreheads.\nIt was the beginning of a long evening.\nThe protestors dressed in black, some of who called themselves \"Black Bloc,\" or \"Antifa\" or who were members of BAMN - By Any Means Necessary, started to throw rocks at the police gathered near the student union. They set off what UC Berkeley Police Chief Margo Bennett called \"commercial grade fireworks,\" and threw Molotov cocktails. They tore apart the metal barricades and threw them into the windows of the Amazon store on the first floor of the student union, shattering the windows.\nMost dramatically, the anarchists set fire to a set of portable lights. At times the flames leaped more than 6 feet into the air, prompting cheers and shouts from many bystanders. Blow horns and drums could be heard echoing through a vast horizon of students fleeing the scene.\nDamage to Amazon store in MLK building. Photo: Frances DinkelspielWithin 20 minutes, around 6:15 p.m., the event was officially canceled. Yiannopoulos was secretly ushered out of the building to an undisclosed location. He later posted a video on his Facebook page bashing what he called the far left.\n\"They will not allow any speaker on campus, even someone as silly and harmless and gay as me, to have their voice heard,\" said Yiannopoulos. \"They won't allow students to hear different points of view.\"\nWhile Yiannopoulos did not get the chance to speak to a room of a few hundred people (the event was also scheduled to be live streamed) after he was secreted off campus he gave interviews about the violent demonstrations to Fox News and other outlets. He then gleefully reported that his forthcoming book, Dangerous, for which he was paid a reported $250,000 advance, had made its way into the top 30 books on Amazon. Yiannopoulos will not be visiting the Cal campus today, as he did at UC Davis earlier this week after another one of his appearances was canceled, as he left for Washington, D.C., according to his Facebook page.\nEven though Yiannopoulos's talk was canceled - the stated goal of many groups - the protests continued for hours, becoming, in parts, increasingly violent as the night progressed. Some masked protesters engaged in paramilitary tactics, throwing debris towards the officers, who responded with pin and paintballs, Bennett said at a press conference later in the evening. No tear gas was used.\nAn injured person at the anti-Milo protests. Photo: Daniel McPartlanOne of President Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" red hats burns during the protest. Photo: Frances DinkelspielBennett said there were not any serious confirmed injuries. But individuals in the crowd were hurt. One man was hit in the head with a bike lock. Another woman was pepper sprayed while she was talking to a reporter. A few people wandered around the crowd with blood dripping from their heads.\nIt was a remarkable as well as an ironic image for a plaza that was the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement and where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once spoke.\n\"We condemn without reservation the violence that was on display and the desires of a few that tainted the actions of many to engage in legal and lawful protest and those who interfered with the ability of [Yiannopolous], the Berkeley College Republicans and members of the audience to exercise their First Amendment rights,\" said UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof.\n\"This is not a proud night for this campus, the home of the Free Speech Movement,\" he said.\nBy 6:30 p.m. the demonstration was divided in two. While the anarchists stayed close to the Pauley Ballroom, waving their flags and sticks, more than 1,500 people stood peacefully on the steps below Sproul Hall, which was lit up in the colors of the LGBTQ movement. A brass band played and many students danced on the plaza.\nThe police by then had taken a mostly hands-off approach, which they continued all night. Many were massed and visible in the MLK student union and some stood on the balcony with their paintball and pepper ball rifles. UC Police regularly issued warnings that the gathering was an unlawful assembly and ordered people to disperse within five minutes or face arrest. However, the police never acted on that threat.\nAround 8 p.m., the crowd suddenly left and crowded along Telegraph and Bancroft Avenues. Some protestors overturned trash cans and set them on fire while other protestors cleaned up the garbage and put out the fires. Cars got stuck at Durant and Telegraph. Protestors would not let them through. At one point, a driver in a white sedan got frustrated and tried to drive through the crowd and had a man dangling off the front hood for a while. Berkeley Police had an unconfirmed report that a car had hit someone, but no one with injuries reported the incident. But Telegraph Avenue was left mostly unscathed.\nBanks, phone stores and Starbucks bore the brunt of the vandalism downtown. Photo: Daniel McPartlanJust before 9 p.m., some of the crowd headed toward downtown Berkeley. When they reached Center Street, some of the anarchists got violent. They smashed the windows of Starbucks and ransacked its interior. They smashed the doors and windows of numerous banks, including the Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo and Mechanics Bank, and set fire and vandalized a number of ATM machines. A number of phone stores also had windows smashed. But the spurt of violence in downtown Berkeley - where they were not confronted by police - was the ending action of the night.\nYvette Felarca, a BUSD teacher and a leader of BAMN, who has been captured on film engaging in violent resistance to right-wing speakers, declared the night a success.\n\"I think shutting down and forcing the cancellation of a white supremacist like Milo Yiannopoulos was a stunning achievement,\" Felarca said around 10:15 p.m. (She was not dressed in black like many of the anarchists in the crowd, nor were the group of about six young people she was with.)\nShe said Yiannopoulos deliberately came on campuses to stir up trouble and his words encouraged people to act out against immigrants, gay people and people of color.\n\"It isn't a question of free speech,\" said Felarca. \"This is about our right to be free of intimidation.\"\nThe events that took place last night, in many ways, mirrored the national anger felt by many and the public response that emanated from the election victory of President Donald Trump. In the past two weeks, Americans have sought to channel their grievances, marching in historic proportions in big cities and the nation's capital. For many, Yiannopoulos' presence on campus reignited protestors' feelings towards the Trump administration and its stances on social issues like immigration.\nFor Sophia Sobko, a Ph.D. student at the School of Education, Yiannopoulos' hostile views towards minorities, women and LGBTQ Americans run deep. \"I honestly am not sure what [tonight's demonstrations] accomplish,\" she said. \"But it is important that we let [Yiannopoulos] know that his rhetoric is not okay.\"\nIn a bit of irony, since Yiannopoulos's speech was canceled, the College Republicans will not be charged the approximately $7,500 security fee they were supposed to pay, said Mogulof. (An anonymous donor had pledged to put up the money for the group.)\nDebates loom over whether or not last night's violence could have been prevented had the university yielded to demands from various campus groups to cancel Yiannopolous' visit. \"The university has no regrets,\" Stephen Sutton, vice chancellor for student affairs, said in response. \"We worked with the Berkeley College Republicans to have the event occur. We sat in meetings with them and we wanted them to have as successful an event as possible.\"\nBerkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin this morning issued a statement condemning the violence.\n\"Destruction and violence are contrary to progressive values and have no place in our community,\" his statement said. \"I support those who peacefully come together in pursuit of a just and inclusive country that stands united with our immigrant population and the many others who are being targeted in this national political climate. Unfortunately, last night, a small minority of the protesters who had assembled in opposition to a speaking engagement featuring a prominent white nationalist engaged in violence and property damage. They also provided the ultra-nationalist far right exactly the images they want to use to try to discredit the vast majority of peaceful protesters in Berkeley and across America who are deeply concerned about where our country is heading.\"\nThe university's Mogulof also reaffirmed that the law prohibits the university from censoring groups and individuals' right to exercise their First Amendment rights. \"This university, in particular, is going to always uphold the Constitution, particularly the First Amendment.\"\nAnother spokeswoman for the university, Christine Shaff said students were pitching in to clean up the city after Wednesday night's demonstrations: \"Berkeley students showed up at 5am in the rain this morning to clean up the plaza and nearby city streets. That's the story that should be told this morning!\"\nTrump, in an early morning tweet, seemed to think the university had tried to stifle free speech (apparently after seeing a commentary on Fox News). He threatened to withdraw federal funds.\n\n\nIf U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS?\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017\n\nThis morning, the university issued another statement condemning the violence and reiterating its determination to preserve First Amendment rights. The statement blamed \"100 armed individuals clad in masks and dark uniforms\" for the troubles. The full text of the university statement follows:\n\"UC Berkeley condemns in the strongest possible terms the actions of individuals who invaded the campus, infiltrated a crowd of peaceful students, and used violent tactics to close down a talk by Milo Yiannopoulos. We deeply regret that the violence unleashed by this group undermined the First Amendment rights of the speaker as well as those who came to lawfully assemble and protest his presence.\n\"The university went to extraordinary lengths to facilitate planning and preparation for this event, working in close concert with the Berkeley College Republicans. Dozens of police officers were brought in from UC campuses across the state. Numerous crowd control measures were put in place. But, we could not plan for the unprecedented. Last night the UC Berkeley campus was invaded by more than 100 armed individuals clad in masks and dark uniforms who utilized paramilitary tactics to engage in violent destructive behavior designed to shut the event down. At that point the University of California Police Department concluded that the speaker had to be evacuated from campus for his own safety, thereby bringing the event to an end.\n\"For the campus police the primary objective is always the safety and well-being of our students and the public. That is what informs their strategies and tactics. In that context we are relieved that, as of now, there have been no reports of serious injuries.\n\"We are proud of our history and legacy as the home of the Free Speech Movement.  While we have made clear our belief that the inflaming rhetoric and provocations of Mr. Yiannopoulos were in marked opposition to the basic values of the university, we respected his right to come to campus and speak once he was invited to do so by a legitimate student group.  The violence last night was an attack on the fundamental values of the university, which stands for and helps to maintain and nurture open inquiry and an inclusive civil society, the bedrock of a genuinely democratic nation. We are now, and will remain in the future, completely committed to free speech as essential to our educational mission and a vital component of our identity at UC Berkeley.\"\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Chaos erupts, protesters shut down Yiannopolous events, banks in downtown vandalized", "Tags": "['Berkeley protests', 'By Any Means Necessary', 'Donald Trump', 'Public safety', 'Southside Berkeley', 'UC Berkeley', 'UC Berkeley protests', 'Yvette Felarca']", "Sections": "['City', 'City', 'Crime & Safety', 'Downtown', 'Politics', 'Schools', 'UC Berkeley']", "Natural Language Location": "UC Berkeley", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.869861", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "246936", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.258765", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/02/chaos-erupts-protesters-shut-yiannopolous-events-banks-downtown-vandalized/", "Author": "Guest contributor", "Date": "2017-02-02T09:15:38-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Large numbers of protestors gathered in front of a rainbow-illuminated Sproul Hall on the UC Berkeley campus hours before Milo Yiannopoulos was scheduled to speak on Feb. 1, 2017.

Pointed out to husband who said, 'Has T***p invaded Mexico?'\"\nAccording to UC Berkeley's news office, \"The Berkeley College Republicans (BCR) will be presenting a performance by Milo Yiannopoulos in the Pauley Ballroom, located on the second floor of the Martin Luther King Jr. Student Union building.\" The event begins at 8 p.m.\nIn a communication to students earlier Wednesday, UCB encouraged \"students who do not wish to participate in or potentially be impacted by the events to consider exploring alternative routes that avoid the Sproul Plaza area.\"\nUniversity spokesman Dan Mogulof told Berkeleyside Cal has \"made concerted efforts\" to ensure campus safety, in part through contact with other campuses to learn about their experiences of similar events. He said he could not share specific security measures that would be taken by the University of California Police Department.\n\"The department was provided with all the resources they need,\" based on a professional assessment, to ensure the security of those attending the event, and those coming to protest it, he said.\nThe university did bring in officers from other UC campuses to ensure adequate resources would be available, he said. UCPD is also in touch with the Berkeley Police Department, but Mogulof said those officers are not on campus and would only be needed if security demands exceed UCPD's capacity to respond.\nBerkeleyside has a reporter and photographers on the scene, and a story is forthcoming.\nStudent groups and others begin to assemble to protest Yiannopoulos event.

I must now also make sure you are aware that Milo, Brietbart and the David Horowitz Freedom Center have published an article today, 1/31/17, stating their intention to use the Berkeley College Republican's event to launch their campaign targeting the undocumented student community on our campus.\"\nThe message continues:\nThere are concerns that he will be employing the strategies of using pictures and personal information of Cal students during his speech which, as you know, is simultaneously being live-streamed therefore making these images widely available and subsequently putting students at risk.\nThere are concerns that he will be employing the strategies of using pictures and personal information of Cal students during his speech which, as you know, is simultaneously being  live-streamed therefore making these images widely available and subsequently putting students at risk.\nAlso, please know other targeted groups on our campus have experienced Horowitz' tactic of publicizing the names and pictures of individuals on posters throughout campus property and there is a likelihood that there will be Horowitz-backed posters pasted throughout our campus tomorrowpublicizing the Milo event in conjunction with targeted individual's names.\nBCR has expressed their position condemning these tactics and, in fact, have been victimized themselves. We are deeply concerned for all students' safety and ability to pursue their education here at Cal beyond Milo's speech. At the bottom of this email are campus resources for reporting incidents.\nPlease let me know your thoughts on what BCR can do to address the concerns that Milo's event may be used to target individuals, either in the audience or by using their personal information in a way that causes them to become human targets to serve a political agenda.

Photo: Lance KnobelAfter years of proposals and discussions, Berkeley City Council on Tuesday unanimously agreed on a new General Fund Reserve policy, often called a rainy day fund. The new policy will immediately raise the reserve to a minimum 13.8% of fiscal year 2017 general fund revenues and aim to hit the city auditor's recommended 16.7% by the end of FY2020 (previous city policy set an 8% unallocated fund balance, not really a reserve). A long-term goal of a 30% reserve is planned to be achieved within no more than 10 years.\n\"It's incredibly important that we have a reserve policy,\" said Mayor Jesse Arreguin. \"Having a clear policy that moves us towards a 30% goal, that gets us to 16.7% in one year, is a major step forward.\"\nCity auditor Ann-Marie Hogan issued a report on general fund reserve policy in February 2016, citing Aesop's fable about the frivolous grasshopper and the industrious ant. In her telling, Berkeley was the grasshopper - doomed to starve when winter comes - rather than the ant who had prudently stored food for hard times. The auditor's report recommended immediate adoption of the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) minimum benchmark of a 16.7% reserve (two months spending), with a goal of reaching 30% or beyond.\nIn a presentation to the Council last night, deputy city manager Jovan Grogan said there were several key reasons for a general fund reserve: to help the city maintain vital services during an economic downturn, to address state and federal actions that may result in revenue reductions, and to help achieve the goal of long-term fiscal stability and mitigate the negative impacts of disasters such as earthquakes, fires and floods.\n\nThe reserve fund will be built by allocating 50% of the city's annual general fund surplus, so-called \"excess equity,\" to the reserve. City manager Dee Ridley-Williams had recommended an immediate 16.7% reserve as well as requiring a two-thirds majority vote for accessing the fund, and then only on a set of specified criteria.\nThe proposal agreed by the Council starts below 16.7% and, following some debate among councilmembers, retains the two-thirds majority for accessing the fund, but requires only a simple majority to change the allocation of excess equity.\nAccording to Hogan, the Council plan makes sense.\n\"I think in the very short term, the timing for getting to 16.7% immediately is difficult in terms of where we are in the budget cycle,\" she said. \"They need to get to that 16.7% swiftly, but I don't think it's feasible to get to it this year. That would be a lot of dislocation in the departments and in the workforce.\"\n\"I wanted to adopt a policy that was realistically achievable,\" Arreguin said. \"Given where we are, setting a goal of 16.7% now would be unattainable. These are very attainable goals that can grow our reserve.\"\n\"Berkeley has really shown leadership in taking this particular step,\" Hogan said. \"This is not a run of the mill thing that everyone is doing that we're late to do.\nRestricted, committed and assigned funds are not available for the reserve. The unassigned funds are split into the Stability Reserve, Catastrophic Reserve and excess equity.The reserve will have two elements: 55% will be a Stability Reserve, used to mitigate loss of service delivery and financial risks associated with unexpected revenue shortfalls; and a Catastrophic Reserve (45% of the fund), used for one-time expenses related to a public emergency.\n\"I don't know whether we're going to be able to count on FEMA in the future,\" said Councilwoman Susan Wengraf, emphasizing the importance of the Catastrophic Reserve. \"I heard the president say today that Alabama is a special place, that Georgia is a special place. Do you think he's going to say Berkeley is a special place?\"\nDuring the Council debate, there was some discussion of whether the policy would help Berkeley's bond rating, currently AA. Bond ratings determine the interest the city pays on its borrowings. Both Arreguin and Hogan agreed that the agreed reserve policy would help.\n\"We're near the top tier of what we need to do to get a AAA rating,\" Hogan said. \"But it's also important that we put something in place that protects the rating we have - and possibly could improve the rating.\"\nCouncilwoman Lori Droste together with Susan Wengraf supported adopting the city manager's plan. But when Wengraf withdrew to support a council consensus, Droste agreed.\n\"It's higher than our current policy, so that's a good thing. I think it's meaningful,\" Droste said. \"I couldn't live with myself if our city suffered a catastrophic event and then we were unable to provide for our citizens.\"\nDroste said that it remains crucial to develop criteria for accessing the reserves, something proposed by Councilwoman Linda Maio, and agreed by the Council's vote.\nThis is long overdue,\" said Arreguin. \"I think it will help the city potentially in the storm we're going through with the new administration.\"\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Berkeley council agrees on rainy day fund policy", "Tags": "['Berkeley city budget', 'Berkeley City Council']", "Sections": "['City', 'City']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley City Council", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.86968", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "245984", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.270894", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/01/26/berkeley-council-agrees-rainy-day-fund-policy/", "Author": "Lance Knobel", "Date": "2017-01-26T08:00:19-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "UC Berkeley students held a rally Dec. 9 to protest against threatened deportations. Photo: Anthony BertolliThe city of Berkeley could lose up to $11.5 million in federal funds if President Donald Trump goes through with his promise to punish sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with immigration law.\nTrump signed two executive orders on Wednesday dealing with immigration, including one to build a wall along the 2,000-mile-border between the U.S. and Mexico. Trump reiterated his promise that Mexico, not U.S. taxpayers, will pay for the wall even though the Mexican president has said his country will not pay a dime.\nTrump also promised to speed up the deportation of undocumented immigrants and punish those who interfered with the efforts.\nIt's unclear, however, just how bad the impact of the executive order will be for Berkeley and other sanctuary cities. The actual wording states that it is the policy of the executive branch to \"ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law.\" Which of Berkeley's federal funds will qualify as \"mandated by law\" is an open question.\n\nBerkeley officials have been expecting an action that might threaten the money the city gets from the federal government. On Nov. 22, then Mayor-elect Jesse Arreguin held a press conference to make clear that he and the City Council will ensure Berkeley remains a sanctuary city, offering protection to immigrants and undocumented residents. Numerous city and school district officials joined with him at the press conference and pledged their dedication to Berkeley's sanctuary status.\nOn Wednesday, Arreguin sent out two tweets addressing the issue.\n\nOur country is a nation of immigrants. Building a wall is not putting #AmericaFirst; it's un-American. #NoBanNoWall\n-- Jesse Arreguin (@JesseArreguin) January 25, 2017\n\n\nWe won't be intimidated by threats to cut funding to cities that believe in the fundamental notion that no person is illegal.\n-- Jesse Arreguin (@JesseArreguin) January 25, 2017\n\nLate today, Arreguin issued a collective press release denouncing Trump's actions with the mayors of Oakland, San Francisco, and San Jose,\n\"Our values of human rights, equity, and inclusion have come under attack by the Trump Administration,\" Arreguin said in the statement. \"In just two days, Trump has pushed a divisive wall, stripped our citizens of civil liberties, and cut funding to cities that have the courage to stand up for all people - whether or not they are legal citizens. We will not be intimidated by threats to cut funding to cities that believe in the fundamental notion that no person is illegal. No amount of federal funding is worth betraying our values.\"\nDonald Evans, the superintendent of BUSD, sent out an email this afternoon reiterating the district's committment to protecting students who are undocumented.\n\"Dear Berkeley Unified School District Families,\nWe want you to know that we are committed to protecting the right of every student to attend public school, regardless of immigration status of the student or of the student's family members.\nOn December 7, 2016, the Berkeley Unified School District Board of Education adopted an official policy that provides protections to immigrant families and affirms the right of undocumented children to a public education. This right has also been upheld by the United States Supreme Court in a case called Plyler v. Doe.\nOn January 25, 2017, the Board will adopt a resolution that reiterates its position that all students have the right to attend our public schools, regardless of the immigration status or religious affiliation of the student or of the student's family members.\nBecause it is our duty and responsibility to provide each child in our District with a high-quality public education in a safe and nurturing environment, we have given these directions to the staff at our schools:\nOur staff will not request information or make a record of information on the immigration status of a student or family member. Furthermore, students and families will not be required to provide a social security number for school forms.\nIf the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency asks for access to a school or for access to student information, they will be politely denied and referred directly to the Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent for Educational Services who will refer the matter to the District's legal counsel.\nAnyone in our schools seeking answers to questions about immigration will be referred to local non-profit immigration law organizations, such as the East Bay Community Law Center and the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant or other recommended resources available on the district website.\nOur immigrant families are not the only ones who are concerned about possible changes in federal policies. We want you to know that our district rejects all discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, gender identity and expression, immigration status, disability and sexual orientation.\nThe core values of our district continue to guide us through these times: Our students are our priority. We take pride in our diversity. We hold high expectations for ourselves and our students. We treat each other with respect and act with integrity.\"\nCongresswoman Barbara Lee also issued a statement: \"Today's directives also take the unprecedented step of targeting sanctuary cities. These cruel, counterproductive policies are designed to terrorize immigrant communities and bully local jurisdictions. My district is home to four proud sanctuary cities: Berkeley, Oakland, Alameda and Emeryville. I refuse to allow the Trump administration to intimidate my constituents. As a member of the Appropriations Committee I will fight tooth and nail to prevent funding for these misguided, anti-immigrant policies.\"\nIn 2015, Berkeley got $11.5 million from various federal agencies, according to an analysis done by city staff. The bulk of that - $6.3 million - came from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Health and Welfare Department provided Berkeley with $2.9 million.\nThis are the funds that Berkeley may lose. Photo: City of BerkeleyBerkeley had expected to lose most of the HUD money anyway with the change of administration, said Stefan Elgstrand, an assistant to Arreguin. Trump is not particularly supportive of subsidizing low-income housing and has appointed Dr. Ben Carson, a doctor who grew up poor but who has no experience in housing issues, as the head of HUD.\nBerkeley expects to make up some of the housing money because two housing initiatives, Measure A1 and U1, passed in November. Those measures will direct funds from a county bond measure and a new tax on rental profits into a housing fund.\nBerkeley is one of more than 300 self-described sanctuary cities around the country. The City Council declared Berkeley to be a City of Refuge in 1971 and has had occasion to re-affirm that status several times since, including in 2007 during local raids by the Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and in 2015 when the city said it would welcome Syrian refugees.\nCity officials do not know how many people have sought sanctuary in Berkeley.\n\"For the safety and privacy of those individuals, we do not keep track of that data,\" Elgstrand wrote in an email.\nTrump first brought up blocking funds for sanctuary cities at a rally in Phoenix in August where he spoke about his immigration plans. He said: \"Block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funding... Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars.\"\nThis article has been updated to include the press release issued by four mayors, one by Rep.

Your protest is an opportunity to make your voice heard, but it is only that. It does not serve to raise awareness of how twisted the alt-right is. Knowledge of their warped perspective and divisive plans already exists. It won't stop them from spewing hate, nor will it stop organizations like Berkeley College Republicans from offering them a venue in which they can share their views with other small-minded bigots. (Yiannopoulos is scheduled to speak at the Pauley Ballroom on Feb. 1.)\nThink of Yiannopoulos not as a journalist or political commentator, but an entertainer. And liberal outrage is a vital part of his theater. Loud protesters only feed his appetite for attention and validate his supporters' claims that protestors and complaints against his events are attempting to suppress their right to free speech. In fact, the Berkeley College Republicans have taken to calling themselves \"The New Free Speech Movement.\" They even use an image from a November 1964 free speech march at Berkeley campus as the cover photo on their Facebook page. Don't be complicit in this. Don't take the bait. Let them have their free speech, but don't let them have the theater. Don't make them believe that they're martyrs. Don't create an environment that draws media attention to the charged, ugly, and sensational battles between liberals and the alt-right. All this does is serve to portray them as victims. Even the so-called progressive media is guilty of offering these hate-mongers free airtime to make their messages heard--a platform to assist in normalizing them and their beliefs.\nProtests for events such as Yiannopolous' don't have the same impact as they did 50 years ago. Consider these alternatives if you plan to protest or if you simply want to DO SOMETHING:\n\nBuy as many tickets as you can to these events. Then and don't show up. Tell your friends and family to do the same. Let alt-right speakers know they can speak where they please, but that doesn't make them welcome. Let them speak to empty seats. Yiannopoulos' event in Berkeley is sold out, but there's no shortage of speeches he and the others like him will make in an effort to spread their vile messages among the public and gain new converts.\nSupport the ACLU. We need them now. We need them to be funded and with full resources so they can prepare for the battles ahead and continue to fight the current ones. They've agreed to set up a table at Upper Sproul Plaza during the Feb. 1st event so that people looking to take some sort of action can choose to do something with lasting impact, such as sign up to fight alongside them.\nFind your pain point and work on it. If you've read this far you're probably a concerned citizen. There is so much at stake right now, pick an issue that boils your blood and put your heart and soul into fixing it. For example, if you're concerned about the GOP's plans to defund Planned Parenthood, form a group to support them monetarily, as a volunteer, or by an awareness campaign to help spread the truth about ALL of the services they provide to EVERYONE. Pledge to make sure Americans know that they are not an abortion drive-thru.\nGet strategic and tactical. Phone calls and in-person visits from constituents to legislators outweigh social media venting and emails. They are hard for legislative staff to ignore if they come in large volume. If you don't reach a lawmaker, staff members typically pass the message along depending on how many calls are made and how you present your story. Also, don't just contact your representatives in Congress, contact officials at the local and state level, too. And take advantage of tools others have used successfully such as the site We are the 65.\nBecome an internet troll. I often see posts on news articles or influential people's communications from right-wingers expounding their beliefs. Start inserting yourself into these ugly and uncomfortable conversations. When they spread fake news, share facts from real resources. When they share fake data, share real data. But don't do it in a combative matter. Join conversations. Take the time to present counter-arguments in a manner that's non-offensive. It's useless to offend. It doesn't help you make your case or win anyone over.\nAnd, talk to people-not just from behind the safe shield of your computer screen. Take inventory of the people you know with beliefs that are aligned with yours. Are there many of them? If so, expand your contacts. It takes time and patience, but when was the last time you had a real conversation about why you believe what you do with someone of an opposing opinion? Even if you can't bring them to your side, your perspective on a particular issue may resonate and make them think twice about their preconceived beliefs about Hillary, Bernie or Jill Stein supporters and some of the same issues we all face.\nBasically, become a citizen activist. If you're not sure how to go about this, do some research and join an organization like The Ella Baker Center, Center for Media Justice, and your local ACLU chapter. Help them move their work forward. Follow individuals like Shaun King, Robert Reich, and Van Jones who are out there fighting and have plans in motion. Get with their plans and become one of their foot soldiers.\n\nThe point is, you can do some much better than a protest. Instead of protesting and joining the alt-right theater, turn your anger into action on Feb. 1 and choose to do any one of these things. And if you have better ideas, make a point of pulling people together to share and act on them. Do something, anything, but don't take the right-wing bait.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Op-ed: Milo Yiannopoulos and the alt-right don't deserve your protest; it only encourages them", "Tags": "['Berkeley protests', 'Donald Trump', 'Southside Berkeley', 'UC Berkeley', 'UC Berkeley protests']", "Sections": "['2016 Election', '2016 Election', 'City', 'Opinion', 'Politics']", "Natural Language Location": "UC Berkeley", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.869861", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "245796", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.258765", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/01/24/op-ed-milo-yiannopoulos-alt-right-dont-deserve-protest-encourages/", "Author": "Guest contributor", "Date": "2017-01-24T13:00:10-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "\"WHAT DO WE DO WHEN WE'RE ATTACKED?\"\n\"WE STAND UP AND WE FIGHT BACK!\"\nOf all the moments during the Women's March in Berkeley on Saturday, those were my favorite -- two small girls, maybe 6 or 7, leading several hundred adults in a chant as we made our way through the Crescent/Springer Gateway back onto campus after having marched along Bancroft and Oxford Streets.\nRead the Berkeleyside article about the march. \nI had my choice of three marches to attend -- one in Oakland, one in San Francisco, and one in Berkeley. Announcements for the one in Berkeley popped up late, only a few days in advance of the march. I signed up, and a day later, someone posted on the activity board, saying the march might not be legit; she'd tried to get in touch with the organizer, Sam Cox, but all the contact info turned out to be bogus. I checked in Berkeleyside, Berkeley's online daily that does thorough and reliable reporting, and the march was listed there. I posted that on the activity board, adding that it looked like a go.\nSaturday morning, minutes before I left for the march, someone named Laura posted that Sam Cox had turned into Pepe the Frog and then into Shadilay, and we'd obviously been pranked. But since many people were already on their way to the march, she'd decided to go. We could make something up on the spot, she wrote, but we wouldn't be able to march down University, as anticipated because we had no permit.\nI decided to go, too. I live only a ten-minute walk from Memorial Glade, where we were to assemble at noon. The day was cool and overcast. I saw several people as I made my way onto campus, but none of them seemed to be heading for the march. Maybe no one would show up. Maybe Laura's post was part of the prank, I thought. But as I got closer to the Campanile, I could see people on the green in front of the Doe Library. Fewer than 200 hundred people had signed up for the march, but there were maybe twice as many there.\nBerkeleyans who showed up Saturday to what turned out to be a fake protest took matters into their own hands. Photo: Cori Kesler\nLaura wasn't part of the prank. Instead, she was making her way through the crowd, explaining to those who hadn't seen her late post that we didn't have a permit to march through the streets. We would figure out a route on campus, she said, but first, we'd gather on the library steps for a photo.\nI climbed to the top step, ending up beside a woman who said to me, as two women arrived on the step below us, that she wished she had one of the pink \"pussy\" hats they wore. Yes, I told her; I'd almost been tempted to revive my knitting, but I'd knit only one thing in my life, a red baby sweater for my daughter that she outgrew in a month, so that was it for me and knitting. The woman didn't knit, either, but said she'd been making coverlets for family and friends using scraps of material joined with an embroidery stitch. It was called Sashiko, she said; it started when poor Japanese fishermen had to patch their jackets, for want of being able to afford new ones. At first, it was just colored thread used for the stitching, but then scraps of other material were used, and Sashiko was born.\nSashiko, I told myself, hoping to remember. By then everyone was on the steps, and three women who said they had nothing to do with organizing the march took turns shouting explanations and instructions. One of them said how fitting it was that we were gathered on the steps of the library, given that Trump didn't read books. We applauded. Another shouted instructions for our route, first to Sather Gate, where we would pose for another photo, then onto Bancroft and down to Oxford, and back through the main gate there.\nAt some point along the way, without confessing the claustrophobia that overwhelms me on crowded public transport, I told Sashiko, as I'd come to think of her, that the march seemed perfect for me, too, so I was glad that Sam Cox, the first pseudonym of the guy who'd pranked it, had waited so long to reveal himself as Shadilay and Pepe the Frog. Sashiko had left her apartment before Laura posted about the prank, but she would have known as soon as she saw the names Shadilay and Pepe the Frog that we'd been pranked because, she told me, both were pseudonyms embraced by the alt-right. By white supremacists. Too bad for them, we agreed; pranked or no, we were raising our voices along with our fists.\nWe were too far back in the line to see what photos on the internet would reveal to me later: our march was being led by five young girls, maybe ten or eleven, each of whom carried a sign. Women's Rights Are Human Rights. Love Trumps Hate. Nobody had what turned out to be my favorite sign of the day, one I saw in a Facebook post from another march: TWO ROADS DIVERGED IN A WOOD, AND AMERICA TOOK THE PSYCHOPATH.\nBut we could see the even younger girls who led the \"What do we do when we're attacked?\" chant: they were right in front of us. As we chanted in response, I could see from the smiles of other adults around me that they, too, felt heartened that the two little girls, who had no doubt witnessed their mothers' grief and frustration after the election, were so passionate, so insistent. They really were the future, and it seemed, watching them, not only wrong but futile to despair. Their chanting ended as we got back to the library steps, and then we began chanting \"Love Trumps Hate. Love Trumps Hate.\"\nI chanted the words as loud as I could, but did I really believe that love trumps hate? And if so, what did such a belief require of me? Since the election, I'd reposted articles from the Times, the Post, and Talking Points Memo to Facebook, adding what I thought of as my own nasty-woman comment. I'd taken but broken vows to stop posting. When I took the vows, it was mostly because I felt chastised and chastened every time I heard President Obama calling for civil discourse or Michelle Obama saying, \"When they go low, we go high.\" I certainly hadn't been going high. I'd even invented several nasty-woman acrostics for Trump, and just that morning, I'd tweeted one of them, tweeted it and then deleted it, ashamed by how far it was from the Obama example. I'd wept as I watched Obama's Farewell Address. I believed him when he said, \"We weaken those ties [that bind us to one another] when we allow our political dialogue to become so corrosive that people of good character aren't even willing to enter into public service; so coarse with rancor that Americans with whom we disagree are not just misguided, but as malevolent.\" Love Trumps Hate. Love Trumps Hate. Surely that was at the heart of Obama's message.\nBut what were its limits? Clearly we weren't chanting that we could defeat Trump by loving him, even if loving him meant only that we could forgive him for his sins of hatred against people of color and immigrants, against the intelligence community and the media, against liberals, against honesty, against truth. Could we love such a sinner while hating only the sins? He was so relentless in his boasting and self-congratulation; he seemed so pathological in his narcissism; and his refusal to learn anymore than he already knew because \"I'm, like, smart\" put all of our lives, along with the lives of others in other countries, along with the life of the planet, at great risk.\nHow to do anything but hate that?\nBut this many women would not be denied. They would not be bamboozled into thinking that war is peace. They would not be persuaded that a drop in the crime rate is \"carnage.\" They would not be fooled into thinking that public education everywhere was a failure; they already knew that it was a failure only in those places where poverty so lowered the tax base that there was inadequate funding for the schools. They would not be cowed into surrendering the rights to their own bodies. GET YOUR THEOLOGY OFF MY BIOLOGY, one woman's sign read. Among the millions of women were hundreds of thousands of men--and boys--who wouldn't be hoodwinked, either.\nOnce we were all back on the library steps, the woman who'd shouted instructions got our attention, more easily this time than at the beginning because now she had a mike. She thanked Eric, a professional singer who lived nearby and had run home to get his own p.a. system. She thanked everyone for coming to this march that almost didn't happen. She explained that we'd been pranked by someone on the alt-right, and then she laughed that we'd actually pranked him--look how many people had turned out. She wasn't used to speaking before large groups, she said. She wasn't a leader; she wasn't even a citizen. She'd been in the country for twelve years and she'd decided, having whined for twelve years about wanting to go back to Canada, that she was going to become a US citizen because she wanted her daughter to see that when things get hard, you don't run; you stand up and fight.\nAll of the speakers urged what I would later read Gloria Steinem had urged the marchers in Washington, to not be content with one day of marching but to ask ourselves what we could do \"tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow and we're never turning back.\" When the speakers began to repeat one another, I decided to walk back home. I thanked Sashiko for her company, wished her good luck in Ecuador, and left.\nAs I climbed the hill to my house, I thought of those Japanese fishermen, patching their jackets with sturdy stitches. I don't have any more patience for sewing than I do for knitting. Otherwise, I'd start by making myself a sashiko coverlet, both to commemorate the day and to serve as a reminder of the work that must be done. I'd stitch in, by way of thanks for creating the march that almost wasn't, an image of Pepe the Frog.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Op-ed: Why the march that got hacked turned out to be one of the best women's marches of all", "Tags": "['Berkeley protests', 'Donald Trump', 'Election 2016 Berkeley', 'UC Berkeley', 'UC Berkeley protests']", "Sections": "['2016 Election', '2016 Election', 'City', 'Opinion', 'Politics']", "Natural Language Location": "UC Berkeley", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.869861", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "245737", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.258765", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/01/24/op-ed-march-got-hacked-turned-one-best-womens-marches/", "Author": "Guest contributor", "Date": "2017-01-24T07:12:55-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Participants in Oakland women's march on Saturday, Jan. 21. Photo: Joshua BloomA day after hundreds of thousands of people in the Bay Area gathered in peaceful protest against the Trump administration, the hard work of political organizing for the next four years was already in full swing.\nAn email went out to grassroots leaders nationwide to fight the Trump agenda, and a surprising thing happened: within hours, 25,000 people signed up for the Sunday evening conference call. At least a dozen of those callers were from Berkeley. The system could not handle that number of callers, so participants were urged to join the discussion online. (It took the automated system more than half an hour to reach all the pre-registered participants.)\nThe call was organized by MoveOn, Indivisible, and the Working Families Party (an East Coast organization working for worker rights). The mood of the call was jubilant, as organizers noted that the size of the Washington Women's March was three times the size of the inauguration crowd. News media have reported that Saturday's marches were possibly the largest single-day worldwide protest event ever.\nSo the question for the call was, \"Where do we go from here?\" The speakers were mostly former Congressional staffers who were working for Democrats in the House and Senate when the Tea Party first came on the scene. Two of the speakers helped write The Indivisible Guide, which lays out an action plan for people on the left who want to reverse-engineer the tactics of the Tea Party and use those to now push Congress back toward the left.\n\nIn The Indivisible Guide, the speakers wrote that Tea Party groups started as \"disaffected conservatives talking to each other online. Groups were small, local, and dedicated. Tea Party groups could be fewer than 10 people, but they were highly localized and dedicated significant personal time and resources. Groups were relatively few in number... On any given day in 2009 or 2010, only twenty local events -- meetings, trainings, town halls, etc. -- were scheduled nationwide. In short, a relatively small number of groups were having a big impact on the national debate.\"\nThat, in brief, is the Indivisible model: organize lots of small, dedicated local groups and keep showing up in Congressional offices. Indivisible is just one of several national left-leaning grassroots groups that has sprung up since the election, and seems to have the most local registered \"chapters\" in Berkeley.\nThe leaders of the weekend conference call offered a 90-minute crash course in political organizing for a post-Trump world. They urged groups to start visiting their members of Congress on a weekly basis, starting Jan. 24, and every subsequent Tuesday (although Tuesday is just the suggested \"day of action\"). For Berkeley residents, this means the offices of Senator Diane Feinstein; Senator Kamala Harris; and Congresswoman Barbara Lee. Even though our Congressional delegates are considered progressive by national standards, Indivisible organizers said they still need to hear from their constituents on a regular basis.\nFor the immediate future, the focus of these Congressional visits, calls, and letters must be the defeat of Trump's Cabinet-level nominees, Indivisible leaders said. \"Let the media know you are going to visit the Congressional offices,\" the speakers said. \"If you don't record it, it didn't happen.  Record everything you do on Facebook, Facebook live, even selfies.  Have a plan for what you want to ask. Focus on whatever is actually happening in Congress that week. Right now they are focused on the Cabinet nominees, so ask what your member of Congress is doing to oppose confirmation of each of the nominees.\"\nIndivisible San Francisco has actually posted Google docs with a suggested script for calling or visiting Sen. Harris. Indivisible East Bay has a longer suggested script for Sen. Feinstein.\nThe national Indivisible team noted that it is rare for a small group to meet with the member of Congress directly. Groups do not need to make appointments, but can go during a time that's convenient to them and ask to speak to the office director or the highest-ranking person who will meet with them. (Though they warn: don't agree to speak to interns.)\nThe Bay Area leaders of grassroots groups expressed concern that our representatives are already quite progressive, and that it would be more important to lobby Red-district legislators. \"Most member of Congress can work even harder for us: they can be bolder,\" the Indivisible leaders said. \"We can't let them off the hook.  We have to let them know we are fighting with everything we've got.\"\nIndivisible pointed out that legislators only really listen to their own constituents, and that legislators can always be persuaded to work harder and more in line with what their constituents actually want. So they urged those in Blue districts to focus on their own delegation, while reaching out to family and friends in Red districts and supporting them in contacting their own delegations.\nThe next Congressional recess will be Feb. 20-24, and legislators generally come to their home districts to meet with constituents at those times. \"Call their office, and politely inquire about their upcoming events. Get on their mailing lists,\" the leaders said. \"Go to the town hall meetings, the ribbon cuttings. Go wherever they are,\" and have a list of items you want to discuss with them.\nThere are an overwhelming number of groups working to defeat various aspects of the Trump agenda right now. Some promote actions that take a morning or an afternoon; others have lists of actions that can be accomplished in minutes. Here is a short list of  groups with a variety of action plans:\nMoveOn: MoveOn has an email list and will suggest a variety of action plans over the coming days and weeks. You can find groups here who will be visiting different congressional offices, or list your own group visit.\nWomen's March: The group that mounted possibly the largest protest ever is continuing its work, with a suggested \"10 actions for the first 100 days.\"\nFirst 100 Ways: \"From January 20th-April 29th, we'll suggest a daily action you can complete in 100 seconds to learn about an important topic, help a progressive cause, or contribute to the greater good.

Photo: Matthew WelchSinger songwriter Rufus Wainwright is set to give an intimate solo performance at Berkeley Symphony's gala this year, which takes place on March 30 at the Craneway Pavilion in Richmond.\nIt's the 13th annual gala for Berkeley Symphony, an event which usually draws several hundred guests and constitutes the orchestra's principle fundraiser.\nEvery year, Berkeley Symphony puts on four main concerts, four chamber music performances, and four family concerts. Although the principle performances take place at Zellerbach Hall, the orchestra is not affiliated with UC Berkeley. In fact it very much belongs to the city, said Audrey Grubb, who, along with her husband DJ Grubb, are co-chairing the gala.\n\"Berkeley Symphony is an enriching civic organization,\" Audrey Grubb said. \"\"It is known globally because of its unique talents; we work with the public schools to provide music education, access to world-class talent, and commission new classical works from composers all over the world. Berkeley Symphony is a reflection of our community -- local, smart, creative and international.\"\n\nThe Symphony is also known for having a young, brilliant female music director. Joana Carneiro, who was born in Portugal in 1976, became the Symphony's third music director in January 2009. Carneiro, who recently gave birth to triplets, is sought after on the international stage. Two years ago she made her debut at the English National Opera conducting the world stage premiere of John Adams's The Gospel According to the Other Mary, and she has conducted orchestras across the world, from Hungary through Sao Paolo. In a 201o profile by Berkeleyside, Carneiro described Berkeley as a place where people were open to investigation and inquiry. \"I think the Berkeley Symphony is a reflection of that spirit - open-minded, where people are open to innovation,\" she said.\nThus year's Berkeley Symphony gala takes place on Thursday March 30 at the Craneway Pavilion in Richmond. Photo: David WeilandAs in previous years, this year's gala will raise funds to support the Symphony's nationally recognized Music in the Schools program.\nThe award-winning program sees the Symphony partner with the Berkeley Unified School District led by conductor and education director Ming Luke. More than 200 in-class sessions are led by Symphony musicians at all eleven BUSD elementary schools each year. Classroom sessions include hands-on music education and curriculum guides for teachers designed to meet state standards for music education. In the middle schools, Berkeley Symphony musicians lead 130 ensemble coaching sessions, 22 master classes, and six ensemble adjudications each year. \"Meet the Symphony\" and \"I'm a Performer!\" concerts take place in BUSD elementary schools, providing young musicians opportunities to rehearse and perform side-by-side with Berkeley Symphony. Four annual Family Concerts provide opportunities for students, their families, and community members to experience a Berkeley Symphony concert together. All Music in the Schools programming is provided free of charge for children and their families.\nBerkeley Symphony's next concert at Zellerbach Hall is Remembrance / Shostakovitch. Set to texts by Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Shostakovitch's epic masterpiece offers \"a blistering denunciation of anti-Semitism and other social ills.\"\nThe Berkeley Symphony gala includes a cocktail reception, dinner and desserts, live and silent auctions, and music by the Carla Kaufman Trio as well as the solo performance by Rufus Wainwright. Tickets for the event, which begins at 6:30 pm, with dinner at 8 p.m., start at $375 and are available at Berkeley Symphony's website, or by phone at 510-841-2800, ext. 1.

Photo: Courtesy Ben AllisonPossessing a thick, woody sound and a rock solid sense of time, Ben Allison is one of most expressive bassists in jazz. But the New York-based bandleader isn't the kind of player who takes a flashy solo every tune. Preferring to guide the proceedings from the churn of the rhythm section, he writes music designed to showcase his superlative crew of collaborators.\nOver the course 12 albums spanning the past two decades Allison has in effect turned a series of exceptional ensembles into his primary instrument. He makes an all-too-rare Bay Area appearance Sunday afternoon at the California Jazz Conservatory with his quartet Think Free, featuring guitarist Steve Cardenas, rising drummer Allan Mednard, and cornetist Kirk Knuffke, who's performed widely around the region in recent years with drummer Allison Miller's Boom Tic Boom and guitarist Charlie Hunter (Think Free also gives an improvisation workshop at the CJC 1 p.m. Sunday).\nIn many ways Allison has sought to forge a musical identity as a composer in response to the inherent challenges posed by his instrument. \"I think it is hard to be a bass player and have a voice that stands out as original,\" says Allison, 50, who also performs Monday with Think Free at the Black Cat in San Francisco.\n\"When you hear a record with Jaco Pastorius or Charles Mingus or Dave Holland, they created a sound that's their own. I aspire to that. But the way I write tunes and put my stamp on a band has been very much part of how I single myself out as a bassist.\"\n\nEven before he released his 1996 debut album Seven Arrows (Koch Jazz), Allison was defining himself as a composer. Part of a rising generation of players drawn to overlooked and rhythmically inventive jazz composers like Herbie Nichols and Andrew Hill, he co-founded the musician-run, non-profit Jazz Composers Collective in 1992, serving as the artistic director through the premiere of hundreds of new works.\nNPR listeners know his music via \"Disposable Genius,\" a piece the weekly show On the Media adopted as a theme. The piece originally appeared on Allison's 2002 album Peace Pipe, a gorgeous album featuring Malian kora master Mamadou Diabate and Berkeley-born multi-instrumentalist Peter Apfelbaum playing tenor sax on three tracks, including \"Disposable Genius\" (Allison has also performed and recorded extensively with Berkeley-reared trumpeter Steven Bernstein's stomping Millennial Territory Orchestra).\n\nThink Free evolved out of his avant chamber jazz ensemble Medicine Wheel, and he's organized it around guitarist Cardenas. The band's first incarnation appeared on the 2006 album Cowboy Justice (Palmetto), a quartet session with trumpeter Ron Horton and drummer Jeff Ballard. Cardenas has appeared on every Allison album since, including last year's vinyl-only Quiet Revolution (Newvelle Records) by Ben and The Easy Way, a new trio with reed player Ted Nash that draws on the seminal drummer-less trio recordings by Jimmy Giuffre and Jim Hall.\n\"I really liked Steve's sound and approach,\" Allison says. \"I had this thought about creating a group with guitar, trumpet, bass and drums, which is not common instrumentation. As a composer, I love creating a new sound, texture and palette. Jenny Scheinman was involved for a while when it was a quintet, then in 2012 it moved to a two-guitar lineup with no horn.\"\nMore recently Allison swapped out the second guitar chair for a trumpeter, touring and recording with the powerhouse Jeremy Pelt (a mutual admiration society, Allison also plays on Pelt's acclaimed 2015 HighNote album Tales, Musings and Other Reveries). Cornetist Knuffke, another startlingly inventive player, is playing with Think Free this tour while Pelt tends to a new baby.\nCardenas first played with Allison in Steven Bernstein's Millennial Territory Orchestra. He's been drawn to the bassist's music by his ability to create new compositions that seem to embrace the musical personalities of his bandmates, while nudging them into slippery sonic territory where footing is less certain.\n\"He can write these very angular things that somehow have melodicism all through them,\" Cardenas says. \"When I first started playing with his band there was a breaking in period, getting used to the concepts. What it came down to is that I could do some much simpler things and really serve the music. He's got specific parts, but I think he hires people based on the way they play and wants them to do what they do. He really thinks about who it is and what they're going to bring to it naturally.\"\nRecommended gigs: Toychestra, Janam\nToychestra, the great experimental ensemble that creates music using toys, celebrates 20 years of sonic exploration Saturday at the Ivy Room.

But it does make it easier to play the part. That's what the all-male drag ballet troupe Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo have been doing since they first releved on stage in 1974, showing the world that ballet can be fun -- even absurd -- and still compete with the best.\nThe Trocks (as the troupe is affectionately known) first performed at UC Berkeley's Cal Performances 40 years ago. They return in March, this time with a new take on two works -- Swan Lake (Act II) and Don Quixote -- that they first presented at their Zellerbach Hall debut in 1976. They'll also do a scene from La Esmeralda.\nJoanna Harris, who received a Ph.D. in drama from Berkeley in 1975, saw the Trocks at their campus debut. She says their mastery allows them to adeptly point out the absurdity of ballet's conventions. \"In order to satirize anybody's work, you have to know it very well,\" she says. \"It's quite remarkable what they do. Most companies take dancing very seriously -- too seriously.\"\n\nThe 16 members of the company dance delicate female roles en pointe and en travesti -- a term that surfaced in Europe a few hundred years ago when men acted both the male and female roles in a play, as it was considered indecent for women to be on stage. (The term \"drag\" comes from this period, too, and started as an acronym -- \"dressed as a girl.\")\nLariska Dumbchenko, played by Raffaele Morra, as Odette and Vyacheslav Legupski, played by Paolo Cervellera, as Siegfried in the pas de deux from Swan Lake (Act II). Photo: Marcello OrselliDrag plays an important role in society, says Juana Rodriguez, a professor of gender and women's studies and performance studies at Berkeley. \"Drag points to the ways in which all forms of femininity and masculinity are artificial, constructed and performed,\" she says.\nThe Trocks playfully poke at gender norms in their dancing. They don't attempt to fully disguise themselves -- a tilt of the head will reveal a protruding Adam's apple; a long leap will display a dancer's chiseled calves; a low-cut dress will expose a hairy chest. After all, they aren't ballerinas -- they're just playing them on stage.\n\"We don't try to perform as women,\" says ballet master Raffaele Morra, who joined the troupe in 2001. \"We just try to do the same roles that a ballerina usually takes, but still approach the steps with a male strength and power.\"\nIn a nod to drag tradition, dancers take on outrageous faux-Russian stage names, complete with backstories. One character, Ida Nevasayneva, is a socialist ballerina who was awarded a plastic metal for \"bad taste\" and became known as a heroine of the Revolution after she lobbed a loaded toe show into a capitalist bank. Another ballerina, Olga Supphozova, is said to have made her first public appearance in a KGB lineup and, after a 7-year hiatus, has returned to the limelight.\nMorra says the Trocks' comedy is always evolving to stay relevant -- what was once funny doesn't always stay funny. And while they aim to entertain their audiences, he says they are never clownish or slapstick, something associate director of Cal Performances Rob Bailis affirms.\nIn the Trocks's version of La Esmeralda, the young gypsy woman is so heartbroken after a wayward romance that not even playing her beloved tambourine can cheer her up. Photo: Zoran Jelenic\"The Trocks so clearly respect the art they parody,\" says Bailis, \"to say nothing of their deep knowledge of the stereotypes they lance with delight and impeccable precision. Their message of inclusion is embedded in the fact that they don't mock ballet. They enhance it. They celebrate it.\"\nThis year, dancer Chase Johnsey received a 2016 award for best male dancer by the Critic's Circle National Dance Awards in the U.K., the first time a male dancer has been nominated and won in a ballerina role. Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo was also nominated for the outstanding company award and Johnsey for outstanding male performance.\nIn addition to performances in Zellerbach Hall, the troupe will stage two other notable events. On March 2 at 6 p.m. in Durham Studio Theater on campus, dancer Robert Carter will transform himself from street clothes to his stage character, Olga Supphozhova, wearing full makeup and costume. Those interested in attending the free event can register online. On March 4 at 10 a.m., members of the company will host a community dance class to teach attendees a short, four-minute ballet, The Dying Swan. The dance workshop is sold out.\nLes Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo appear March 3 and 4 at Zellerbach Hall. Tickets start at $36 and can be purchased online, by phone at (510) 642-9988 or at the ticket office. Tickets are available at half-price to UC Berkeley students.

Employed for centuries as mousers aboard merchant vessels plying the Mediterranean and Black Seas, countless felines jumped ship on the banks of the Bosphorus in search of a new life (and perhaps some less demanding and more cooperative humans).\nThey found both - and now, they even have their very own feature-length documentary! Taking its title from the Turkish word for cat, Kedi is the real deal: never again will you have to settle for poorly produced, low-budget viral videos of felines running railway stations, jumping through snow banks or simply being adorable.\nWhile I've never been to Istanbul (or anywhere east of Majorca, for that matter), the evidence in Kedi suggests that cohorts of marauding moggies do indeed rule the city's streets. Lean, wild, and for the most part defiantly unfixed, these cats are the ultimate bohemians, living and loving as they see fit and with no apologies.\nHappily for them, most of Istanbul's humans seem more than willing to play along. The film depicts residents eagerly doing whatever it takes to please their furry masters: feeding them, grooming them, petting them, caring for their kittens, and basically following orders.\n\nThere are, of course, problems. So-called 'urban renewal' has reached Istanbul, decreasing the amount of greenbelt space available to local cats and forcing them to move into more tightly packed residential areas. Setting a fine example for the rest of us, the city's two-legged inhabitants have uncomplainingly taken in this influx of four-legged newcomers.\nThough uniformly imperious, Istanbul's cats come in all shapes, sizes and colors. Big fluffy Norwegians, scrawny tabbies and tortoiseshells and shorthaired mutts are all well represented in Kedi, some more photogenic than others. None, however, are quite as special as Smokey the restaurant cat.*\nDescribed as 'a cat with manners' by the chef of the neighborhood bistro he prowls, Smokey is far too dignified to beg for food from the restaurant's customers - in fact, he doesn't even go inside, instead keeping an eye on streetside happenings whilst providing stoic company for patio diners. When feeling a little peckish, he knocks politely on the window. You have to see it to believe it.\nThis 80-minute celebration of the species felis catus occasionally wanders into headier territory. One gentleman explains how caring for several dozen cats has saved him from a life of manic depression; another expounds on spirituality, explaining that while dogs think humans are God, cats know they're merely God's middle men.\nIn sum, this is perfect family viewing that should also appeal to cineastes, who will note with approval the similarities between director Ceyda Torun's ground-level camera work and the renowned tatami shots of Yasujiro Ozu. Perhaps that's a stretch, but compared to the camera work in Little Kittens Meowing and Talking it seems pretty reasonable.\n*Note to Smokey: you should hire a new publicity agent.

Photo: Courtesy the artistThere are probably no more than two degrees of separation between every Brazilian music gig in the Bay Area and Marcos Silva, which is a primary reason the region boasts such a rich scene.\nThe Rio de Janeiro-born pianist initially made his mark as an ace accompanist, first in Rio and then New York City. He gained his widest audience during a two-decade run as music director for Flora Purim and Airto. But he's put his performing career on the backburner since launching the Brazilian music program at the California Jazz Conservatory in 1997 (when it was known as the Jazzschool and located upstairs from La Note).\nSilva plays a rare gig presenting his own music 4:30 p.m. Sunday at the CJC with his quartet featuring Zach Pitt-Smith on woodwinds, electric bassist Scott Thompson and drummer Phil Thompson (no relation). Purim has recorded at least half-a-dozen Silva songs, and he's released two albums under his own name, but the pianist has more than 60 originals in his book, and countless arrangements of tunes by other composers.\n\"I'm still writing,\" he said during a recent conversation in the CJC's Hardymon Hall. \"I just wrote a piece last Monday that I'm going to play solo piano on Sunday.\"\n\nDuring the late afternoon interview the CJC was bustling, and our conversation was interrupted numerous times as friends and students came by our table to give Silva hugs and kisses. When he wanted to remember the name of a standard he had played he went from table to table accosting musicians while humming the tune until someone recognized it (\"There Is Not Greater Love\"). Teaching seven courses a week at the CJC plus private lessons he probably spends more time at the downtown Berkeley school than at his home in Oakland.\nIn many ways the CJC amplified his already pervasive influence on the Bay Area scene. Vocalist Sandy Cressman has said that Silva's mentorship gave her a foundation strong enough to collaborate with some of the most acclaimed Brazilian musicians on her new album Entre Amigos. He joined forces with vocalist Mary D'Orazi, a former student of his, on her gorgeous 2016 album To Brasil to Bacharach: A Tribute (which garnered an approving letter from Burt himself). D'Orazi plays the CJC on April 15 with Silva, bassist Brendan Neutra, drummer Greg German, and reed expert Harvey Wainapel (who plays the Jazz at the Chimes series with his Brazilian jazz combo Alegritude on March 19, and credits Silva with sparking a Brazilian music epiphany that has driven his creative evolution since 1980).\nWith more than two decades of teaching under his belt, Silva has trained a generation of American musicians who are fully equipped to play Brazilian music with Brazilians on their own turf. That means he's raised up players who can meet his own exacting standards, like his Thompson-powered rhythm section.\nBassist Scott Thompson is an extreme but telling example of Silva's pedagogic prowess. He was exposed to Silva's playing in utero, as his mother, saxophonist Mary Fettig, was playing in the pianist's band when she was pregnant. His earliest memory as a toddler is Silva's group performing with the great Brazilian guitarist/composer Toninho Horta.\n\nHe started studying the bass with Jeff Neighbor, who gave him a solid foundation, in preparation for enrolling with Silva. \"I knew he was a hard teacher and that he'd really push the students,\" Thompson said. \"I didn't want to just jump in as a beginner. I was about 15 when I started taking his class at the Jazzschool, and he recommended I go to Brazil Camp in Cazadero.\"\nThompson wasn't 20 yet when Silva called him to sub on a gig. He's been working with him ever since, and regularly gets hired to perform with major artists such as Toninho Horta, guitarist Chico Pinheiro, and the samba jazz quartet led by the mother and daughter team of pianist Debora and vocalist Dani Gurgel.\n\"Marcos groomed me and Phil to play in his band,\" Thompson said. \"For me, it's totally changed the way I think about music, and led to several tours with groups from Brazil. That mentorship was huge for me, but I see his impact throughout the Bay Area. A lot of what happens in the Brazilian music scene wouldn't happen if not for Marcos.\"\nWhile Silva was well established on the Rio scene in the late 1970s, he wanted to delve deeper into jazz. Like so many ambitious musicians before him, he decided to make his way to New York City. He left Brazil in the fall of 1979 for performances in Venezuela and Panama and landed in New York in March 1980, speaking little English and knowing only a few musicians.\nDrummer Danny Gottlieb, an original member of the Pat Metheny Group, introduced him to vocalist Flora Purim and her husband, percussion genius Airto Moreira, a connection that changed the course of Silva's career. They had broken through to a much wider audience in the 1970s through their work with Stan Getz and the first incarnation of Chick Corea's Return to Forever. Recording for Berkeley-based Milestone, they released a string of popular albums.\nSoon after joining the couple he moved out to Santa Barbara where they were based. By 1986 he had relocated to the East Bay to join the band Voz do Brasil at the invitation of Brazilian-born drummer Celso Alberti. Performing with Purim and Airto meant he was constantly meeting up with jazz royalty, like trumpeter Lew Soloff, drummer Lenny White, and just-departed guitarist Larry Coryell. He can tell stories about the time Jaco Pastorius sat in with the band at the Bottom Line (playing a tune of Silva's that Herbie Mann recorded, \"Dry Land\"). He got to know Herbie Hancock and Dori Caymmi, with whom he went on to tour and record.\nWhen Jazzschool founder Susan Muscarella approached him about teaching Brazilian music in 1997 he was skeptical there would be enough demand. But more students kept coming, and before long he was teaching nine classes a week. \"I couldn't even go home to sleep anymore,\" he said.\nFor Silva, teaching serious students isn't about making them clones. He wants to prepare them to interpret a composer's music from the inside. Rather than focus on bossa nova standards, he's kept his ear to the ground, teaching music by contemporary artists like Guinga and Chico Pinheiro.\n\"I give credit to the guys who were there,\" he said. \"They wanted to learn what was new. I see music according to the composer. It's not according to Marcos Silva. I teach according to what the composers want.\"\nSilva's beautiful music deserves to be more widely heard too, and he's created an ideal cast to play it.\nRecommended gigs: Steve McQuarry / Amy X Neuburg\nOakland pianist Steve McQuarry presents a tribute to great African-American composers Saturday at the California Jazz Conservatory with his Special Edition Band featuring flutist Gerald Beckett, bassist Kash Killion, drummer Greg German, conguero Jesus Gonzalez, and Destiny Muhammad on harp and vocals.\nAmy X Neuburg curates a diverse night of music Saturday at the JCCEB.

This week they're offering us a very rare opportunity to appreciate the work of Belorussian filmmaker Sergei Loznitsa, whose work has always performed well at festivals but never had a general release in the United States - not even on the art-house circuit.\nThe Archive's short-but-sweet series Afterimage: Sergei Loznitsa corrects this oversight, with eight of his films screening over the course of a whirlwind three days. As an added bonus, the director will appear in-person throughout the series.\nBlokada (Blockade, 2005), a remarkable newsreel 'recreation' of the 900-day siege imposed on Leningrad during World War II, begins the series at 7 p.m. on Wed. Feb. 22. Assembling 52 minutes of archival footage into a coherent 'story', the film foregrounds the suffering and fortitude of the city's citizens, who've primarily served as cinematic wallpaper in countless narration-driven WW2 documentaries.\n\nBlockade eschews voiceover in favor of carefully crafted and expertly applied sound effects. These effects draw our attention to what is actually happening onscreen: the city going about its normal affairs in the early days of the siege, the terrifying experience of a fiery air raid, and the cruel and deadly realities of life in a besieged city, where corpses on the street became a normal sight. Accompanied by Loznitsa's 2015 short The Old Jewish Cemetery, Blockade is a unique and powerful viewing experience.\nWhile thematically not entirely dissimilar, V Tumane (In the Fog, screening at 7:30 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 24) couldn't be much different stylistically. On the surface a traditional drama about Belorussian partisans and their underground war against Nazi occupiers, the film takes on issues of resistance, loyalty, and betrayal that elevate it far above the run-of-the-mill war movie.\nBeautifully shot and composed by cinematographer Oleg Mutu (who'd previously filmed 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days for Romanian director Cristian Mungiu), In the Fog focuses on two partisans assigned the task of executing a rail worker suspected of collaborating with the Germans. The fact that the man is a friend - and that he stubbornly insists on his innocence - doesn't make their mission any easier, but wartime circumstances demand a swift and emotionless resolution.\n'Me Estas Matando Susana' ('You're Killing Me Susana')\nVeronica Echegui and Gael Garcia Bernal in You're Killing Me SusanaI've been writing a lot lately about the continuing renaissance of Mexican cinema, and was eager to scope out Me Estas Matando Susana (You're Killing Me Susana), opening at San Francisco's Roxie Theater on Friday, Feb. 26. Does the renaissance extend into the domain of the mainstream comedy-drama?\nApparently not. Though Susana features an excellent performance from the ubiquitous Gael Garcia Bernal as Eligio, a jealous husband whose wife (Veronica Echegui) has left him without warning to attend a writing workshop in Iowa, the film fails to cohere as either drama or romantic comedy. We're supposed to laugh at Eligio's stereotypical macho posturing and absurd behavior, but he simply comes across as an asshole, and the film's final scene inexplicably rewards his misbehavior.

Except that the Nile Project, a pioneering trans-national organization, has extended the river's reach well into the East Bay, most conspicuously with the return of the Nile Project's musical collective to Zellerbach Hall 8 p.m. Saturday.\nThe touring ensemble features musicians who hail from Sudan, Ethiopia, Egypt, Burundi, and Kenya, a band sifted from a larger collective of 35 musicians. While drawing on traditional songs and playing traditional instruments like the region-wide lute-like tanbour, the Ethiopian krar harp, the Egyptian kawala flute, and the Burundian ikembe thumb piano, the musicians create startling new arrangements via unprecedented cross cultural collaboration. The musicians also employ sundry percussion and stringed instruments, guitars, and voices, a sound captured on the new album Jinja.\nThe performance is just one ripple in a much larger wave of activity. It's not just that Ethiopian-born Berkeley based singer/songwriter Meklit co-founded the organization with Egyptian musicologist Mina Girgis. Saturday's concert is part of a larger Nile Project residency that includes Cal Performances' partnership with the BUSD, with every sixth-grade class attending a Friday matinee SchoolTime performance.\nThe Nile Project artists also host a Nile Gathering Reunion on Friday afternoon at the Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life, a free program that includes a musical collaboration, water cooperation lecture demonstration, and a 6:30 p.m. vocal and percussion-based community music session.\n\n\n\"UC Berkeley has become our home campus after our collaboration in 2015,\" says Nile Project CEO and producer Mina Girgis, who gives a pre-performance talk before Saturday evening performance that's free to concert ticketholders. \"The way the project started in San Francisco, it's like bringing back the Nile to the Bay Area. We're coming back and sharing what we've been doing on the road.\"\nThe epiphany that sparked the Nile Project actually took place in Oakland. Girgis and Meklit, a TED Global Fellow, were hanging out after a mind-blowing concert at Sweet's Ballroom in Oakland that paired the Ethiopian music and dance combo Fendika with the Debo Band, which draws much of its inspiration from Ethio-jazz legend Mulatu Astatke.\nAfterwards, she and Girgis were struck by the fact that \"we have to be in the diaspora to hear each other's music,\" Meklit says. \"In the Bay Area we're neighbors and friends, but on the continent there's very little access to each other's music. He said, what if we bring musicians from the Nile together to make music?\"\nOn hiatus from the Nile Project, Meklit nonetheless has taken insights gleaned from her East African travels with the collective and applied them to her guest artistic director stint with UnderCover Presents production A Tribute to The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, which happens to run this weekend at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (featuring Berkeley artists like Faye Carol, Kimiko Joy and Howard Wiley).\nFrom the beginning Girgis and Meklit had their eye on the big picture, with music serving is a vehicle for creating larger conversations about the Nile Delta, a region beset by resource rivalry and conflict dating back to the colonial era, if not earlier. The project's mission is to create conditions on the ground fostering collaborations cultivating the sustainability of the shared ecosystem using music as a foundational force. Needless to say, history has not stood still since the launched the project.\nMeklit. Photo: Pete RososMeklit spoke at and performed at Berkeleyside's Uncharted Berkeley Festival of Ideas in 2015. Learn more about the festival which takes place every October in Berkeley.\n\"It's been a tumultuous six years since the uprising in Egypt, which was part of the inspiration for this project,\" Girgis says. \"Everyone is so daunted by uncertainties, and there's a protectionist instinct on so many levels. Governments are responding to fundamentalist Islam, and Trump just created this travel ban. It's a difficult time to be in the business of building bridges and developing platforms that bring people together.\"\nThe 2015 residency was part of the inaugural run of Cal Performances Berkeley RADICAL initiative (a name drawn from Research And Development Initiative In Creativity, Arts, Learning). Since then, the Nile Project has partnered with six universities in Egypt, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda, and launched its inaugural class of Nile Fellows. The year-long leadership seeks to leverage the collective's influence by selecting 24 students from partner universities to establish Nile Project Clubs on their campuses.\nSome of the most exciting developments take place as the musicians spent time with each other and exchange ideas. For Sudanese vocalist and percussionist Asia Madani, a resident of Cairo, the Nile Project has opened a door \"to discover a lot beyond Sudan and Egyptian music,\" she says speaking in Arabic, with Girgis serving as translator. \"I started meeting musicians from other countries and discovered that many Sudanese rhythms I play are actually played in other parts of Nile Basin. All these musical ideas are connected. And as we develop friendships it changes the perspective of people from that country.\"\nThe musicians arrived in the US in mid-January, and just made it under the wire. \"If we had waited a week we wouldn't have all made it,\" Girgis says. \"There's a sense of urgency, that we might not be able to come back and this residency might not happen again. In a way it makes us feel our work can not be any better timed.\"\nRecommended gig: Pianist Keith Saunders\nPianist Keith Saunders performs at St. Albans Sunday at 4 p.m. Photo: Tim BurgessAlbany pianist Keith Saunders, a veteran New York player who moved to the East Bay about six years ago, kicks off the new Third Sunday jazz concert series presented by St. Alban's Episcopal Church in Albany.\nSince landing in the Bay Area, he's worked extensively with guitar great Calvin Keys, first at the 57th Street Gallery and for the past few years every Monday at the Birdland Jazzista Social Club (which is closing at the end of February).\nFor his St. Albans concert, he's playing an opening trio set with Berkeley bass master Peter Barshay and Oakland drummer Ron Marabuto focusing on the music of Bud Powell.\nFor the second set, they'll be joined by Berkeley saxophonist Bob Kenmotsu, \"doing songs I really like to play,\" Saunders says. \"Hank Mobley's 'Work Out,' the ballad 'Blue Gardenia,' a calypso by saxophonist Ralph Lalama that Elvin Jones played 'Antigua,' mostly hard bop.\"\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "A river runs through Berkeley with the return of the Nile Project", "Tags": "['Berkeley music']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'Music']", "Natural Language Location": "UC Berkeley Zellerbach Hall", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.869143", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "248620", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.260821", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/16/river-runs-berkeley-return-nile-project/", "Author": "Andrew Gilbert", "Date": "2017-02-16T11:47:59-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "The California Quail was named state bird after an extensive public outreach campaign and election led by Audubon in the 1920s.

It also dove quickly into conservation advocacy.\n\nThe group's first major campaign involved deadly oil spills on California waters. With automobile ownership spreading, oil shipment had become a fast-growing business. Tankers were discharging contaminated ballast water off the Farallon Islands, one of the most important seabird breeding sites on the Pacific Coast. Oil slicks were being reported every two to three weeks.\nAudubon leaders met with oil company officials in 1919 and convinced them to start recycling waste oil at onshore facilities rather than dumping in the ocean.\n\"These actions were a crucial early step in protecting the Farallones and were probably among the first organized conservation efforts to stop oil dumping at sea,\" wrote Harry Fuller, author of a forthcoming book on the natural history of San Francisco.\nOver the following century, Golden Gate Audubon tackled issues ranging from choosing a state bird (winner: California Quail) in the 1920s, to preservation of shoreline habitat; creation of parks like Point Pinole and Eastshore State Park; purchase of the Audubon Canyon Ranch nature preserve in West Marin; protection of the nesting colony of endangered Least Terns at Alameda Point; and reduction of bird deaths from Altamont Pass wind turbines.\nGGAS field trip to the Farallon Islands in 1969. Photo: courtesy of GGASIn Berkeley, GGAS had decades of involvement with Aquatic Park. In 1948, the group opposed a proposal by the city to fill in the lagoon. It subsequently conducted a series of bird censuses at Aquatic Park and co-sponsored nature talks there with the city in the early 1950s. In the 1960s and early 70s, GGAS sponsored a nature education training program for Berkeley teachers at Aquatic Park.\nMore recently, GGAS advocated for preservation of marsh and mud flat habitat along the Berkeley shoreline during the creation of Cesar Chavez Park. Its volunteers became staunch advocates for wildlife in the park, particularly the Burrowing Owls that spend the winter in ground squirrel burrows there. Each year GGAS organizes volunteer docents, who take up position with spotting scopes and binoculars to help parkgoers spot the tiny brown raptors. (As of this February, there is currently one Burrowing Owl residing near the rip-rap on the north side of the park, a second in the meadow, and a third near Albany Bulb. A fourth owl was sadly found dead on a park bench in late November.)\nOver the past century, GGAS grew from an initial handful of members to more than 7,000 today. (Thus that guesstimate of 7,000 pairs of binoculars. J ) It offers over 150 free field trips and about two dozen birding classes each year.\nWhen it came time to plan its centennial, the organization considered holding a gala dinner like many non-profits. But it opted instead to create a traveling educational exhibit focused on Bay Area birds and Audubon's achievements on their behalf.\n About the exhibit Golden Gate Audubon's Centennial exhibit will be on display through March 31, 2017 at the Environmental Education Center at Tilden Regional Park, 600 Canon Drive, Tuesdays through Saturdays., 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Make the most of your visit!

Or visit GGAS's web site to learn about upcoming field trips, birding classes, and volunteer opportunities.\"We wanted to do something outward-facing that would introduce Audubon to communities that may never have heard of us before,\" Cindy Margulis said. \"We hope the exhibit will inspire people to pause and look at that Chestnut-backed Chickadee in their backyard or the ducks and herons along the shoreline. When they want to learn more about those birds and help them thrive, we're here to assist with field trips, classes, and volunteer opportunities.\"\nThroughout 2017, the exhibit will be on display for free at public venues including Tilden Park, Oakland City Hall, the Tides/Thoreau Center in the Presidio, and Lindsay Wildlife Experience in Walnut Creek.To create the exhibit, Audubon connected last spring with a Berkeley-based graduate class in Museum Studies at JFK University. Professor Brianna Cutts adopted the GGAS Centennial as the class project, and students came up with the concept of a series of tall nylon panels featuring photos and text about Bay Area birds and GGAS volunteers. Then GGAS enlisted pro bono graphic design services from Airloom, a Berkeley marketing and design firm, to create the actual panels.\nGGAS kicked off the exhibit's visit to Tilden Park on Feb. 4 with a reception featuring East Bay Regional Park District Board President Beverly Lane and General Manager Robert Doyle.\n\"Audubon fought against development, even litigated, to protect shorebirds and habitat,\" Doyle told the crowd at the launch. \"I can't tell you how important that is....

The nominees screen at San Francisco's Roxie Theater beginning Saturday, Feb. 18, and no East Bay play dates are scheduled. (The short live-action and animated films are playing at Landmark Shattuck Cinemas, however, and you can read my review from last week.)\nI'm going to guess that local favorite Extremis is least likely to take the Oscar home on Feb. 26. The second documentary recently shot at Oakland's Highland Hospital, Extremis focuses on the facility's Intensive Care Unit and the difficult ethical decisions staff confront there on a daily basis. Though excellent, the film is probably too raw a gut-punch for your average mortality-conscious Academy voter, and end-of-life documentaries haven't fared well in the past -- I considered Prison Terminal: The Last Days of Private Jack Ward a lock in 2014, and... well, it wasn't.\nIn sharp contrast, Joe's Violin is the sort of feel-good documentary the Academy has taken a shine to in recent years. The story of a Holocaust survivor who donates his beloved violin (purchased in a displaced person's camp in 1947) to the (deep breath) Bronx Global Learning Institute for Girls Charter School, the film benefits from a) its protagonist still being alive and b) the recipient of the violin being a delightfully bubbly 13-year-old. As charming as it is, Joe's Violin doesn't deserve to win, but probably will.\nThe final three films each deal with different aspects of the still unfolding Middle Eastern disaster unleashed by George W. Bush post- 9/11. The least of the trio is The White Helmets, an examination of the titular Syrian rescue organization of the same name. Hagiographic in tone, the film doesn't dare touch on the controversies surrounding the Helmets, and, despite some riveting rescue scenes, just didn't do a lot for me.\n\nFar more effective was 4.1 Miles, which should be receiving the accolades and attention being heaped upon Best Documentary Feature nominee Fire at Sea. Shot on and around the Greek island of Lesbos, a transit point for more than half a million refugees since the turn of the century, the film is direct, immediate, and powerful. Fire at Sea may be high art but 4.1 Miles is the film refugee advocates will want people to see.\nFinally, Watani My Homeland is a slow burner that really pulled me in. Shot in Aleppo and Germany over the course of three years, the film details the journey of a Free Syrian Army commander's family from their devastated homeland to a new life in Germany. At 40 minutes, the film allows us to get to know the family, who don't fulfill anyone's stereotypes of 'typical refugees'. It would be a well-deserved winner (as would 4.1 Miles), but I'm still putting my metaphorical money on Joe's Violin.\n'Korla' documentary, about TV personality Korla Pandit, airs on PBS\nEarly television star Korla Pandit, star of Berkeleyan John Turner's TV documentary Korla which will air on PBSIf you're much under 70 (or haven't been involved in the exotica or lounge scenes) the name Korla Pandit probably won't mean anything to you, but there was a time when -- at least in Southern California -- he was as popular with housewives as Liberace.

Photo: Kevin Berne/Berkeley RepHand to God, a Tony-nominated, riotously funny romp, shaded with black undertones, uses a foul-mouthed sock puppet to demonstrate the shocking results when one is freed from society's moral restraints. Playwright Robert Askins accomplishes this lesson using ribald humor overlaying searing insights. With a very talented cast and tight direction by David Ivers (One Man, Two Guvnors), Hand to God is a sparkling 100-minutes of comedy and calamity.\nTeenaged Jason (actor Michael Doherty is a tour de force), living in suburban Texas, is lonely, insecure and superficially sweet. But he is consumed with repressed anger over the recent death of his innocuous father, which he channels toward his newly widowed mother, the outwardly conforming, but off-kilter Margery (excellent Laura Odeh). A very anxious Margery is short of funds, and so has invented a small job for herself teaching her Lutheran ministry's teen puppets-for-Jesus class. Or does the solitary, ineffective Pastor Greg (well-acted by David Kelly, It Can't Happen Here) offer her the job just to keep Margery close to him?\nAttending the puppet class with Jason is his crush, the lovely Jessica (fine Carolina Sanchez), although, as a puppet snob, she would prefer to work with the Balinese shadow variety. Sneering, surly Timothy (talented Michael McIntire), the third participant, only sits in on the puppet lessons while his mother is at rehab meetings.\nWhen Timothy makes raunchy remarks to Jessica, Jason's puppet, the red-headed, large-mouthed Tyrone, seemingly takes on a devilish personality all his own, and launches into Timothy, using filthy language that Jason would never bring himself to use. Tyrone spews out all of Jason's lust and wrath, while Jason seems incapable of stopping the puppet from broadcasting all of Jason's anger and carnal impulses.\n\nMargery, perhaps freed from her inhibitions by observing Tyrone, acts on her inappropriate sexual urges, as hilarity ensues. In the second act, Tyrone has developed sharp teeth, which he uses on Jason and others, as he grows cruder and more agitated, until he and Jessica's sexy puppet, Jolene, engage in laugh-out-loud X-rated puppet sex.\nNo character in Hand to God is free from sin and hypocrisy. And that includes Pastor Greg, whose desire for Margery has loosened his own reserves. Although he doesn't get around to an exorcism on Jason/Tyrone, it's all he can think to do to remedy the situation.\nWhat is remarkable about Hand to God is how the audience seems to view Tyrone as human, separate and apart from Jason. That's how talented at acting and puppetry Michael Doherty is as Jason/Tyrone. Tyrone's face and arm gestures are inexplicitly expressive, even though he's just a sock. There is no ventriloquism; we see Jason's mouth move when he assumes Tyrone's voice, but we allow ourselves to be persuaded that it is Tyrone speaking. Perhaps it is because we can't wait to see what Tyrone will do next.\nA Texan by birth, Robert Askins knows the realm of fundamental Christianity, as well as the personality of the religious hypocrite. He uses his knowledge to full humorous effect in Hand to God. But beneath the laughs are truths about the dark urges we all have and the burdens and benefits of societal inhibitions.\nHand to God plays through March 19.

Photo: Scott ChernisOver the past 15 years or so the Albany saxophonist Michael Zilber has recorded a series of critically hailed collaborations, joining forces with an imposing array of master improvers like drum maestro Steve Smith, saxophone legend Dave Liebman, and the painterly guitar explorer John Stowell.\nBut Zilber's latest album Originals for the Originals (Origin) is the kind of project that doesn't accommodate a co-leader. A highly personal tribute to his saxophone heroes, the album summons the spirits of transcendent talents like John Coltrane, Michael Brecker, Wayne Shorter, Sonny Rollins and Paul Desmond. Rather than trying to evoke the unmistakable sounds of these storied players, he bases each piece on a melodic phrase or harmonic passage drawn from their music.\n\"It's an homage, but I'm not trying to be a copycat,\" says Zilber, who celebrates the album's release Friday at the California Jazz Conservatory with pianist Matt Clark, bassist Peter Barshay, and drummer Akira Tana.\n\"With almost every piece there was something specific I was inspired by. Joe Henderson's most famous composition is 'Inner Urge.' The piece I wrote for him 'Hen House' takes the chord changes backwards, and the rhythmic shape is also inspired by 'Inner Urge.'\"\n\nThat might sound like inside baseball to non-musicians--I couldn't hear the mirrored harmonic structure on 'Hen House' though the tune did sound strangely familiar--but Zilber's music is as emotionally compelling as it is heady. Part of what makes Originals so consistently engaging is that he possesses a striking sound of his own. On tenor it's thick, bright and pliable with a rounded edge, while his keen and imploring soprano sound sax tone emerges softened, as through a scrim of gauze.\nReared in Vancouver, British Columbia and shaped by the rigorous scenes in Boston and New York City, Zilber has maintained strong ties to the East Coast, and 10 of the 11 tracks on Originals feature a top-shelf New York rhythm section with pianist Dave Kikoski, bassist James Genus, and drummer Clarence Penn.\n\"I will always be bi-coastal,\" says Zilber, who runs the jazz program as Los Medanos College and teaches regularly at the CJC. \"I knew Kikoski from New York and James Genus was the bassist in my band for the last three years there. I love the way they play. I really think Kikoski is one of the 10 greatest living jazz piano players. I always wanted to do a record with him and I thought this material was ideal.\"\nHis CJC band with Clark, Barshay and Tana play on one track (\"Hen House\"), and it's no coincidence that they all spent significant time on the New York scene. It's also no coincidence that Zilber includes two contrasting pieces he wrote inspired by powerhouse saxophonist Dave Liebman, a longtime friend and mentor with whom he recorded the 2003 album Live at the Jazzschool. (Full disclosure: I wrote the liner notes).\nThe luscious ballad \"Autumn Lieb\" includes a fragment of the standard \"Autumn Leaves,\" a tune that Liebman has recorded several times, while \"Lieb Dich\" is a torrid burner that employs an interval from Cole Porter's \"I Love You.\"\n\"Some people call me a disciple of Lieb's, and he was definitely a mentor and a real inspiration,\" Zilber says. \"He got me my first record deal with the French label Owl Records, back when people could get other people record deals.\"\nIf there's one track that's something of a surprise it's the closer \"St. Paul (Desmond),\" which is the album's longest piece at almost 11 minutes. A gorgeous ballad statement inspired by the Dave Brubeck Quartet's long-time alto saxophonist, it builds off an opening phrase from \"Emily.\" Zilber encountered Desmond's ethereal version of the haunting Johnny Mandel theme on the altoist's 1969 album Summertime (CTI) as a novice saxophonist just starting to transcribe solos.\nA prolific composer, Zilber has played an important role in the Electric Squeezebox Orchestra as a player and writer, contributing numerous pieces to the band's repertoire. While he wrote several pieces specifically for Originals, he's been writing tunes in this vein for years. Part of the fun of creating the album was putting the pieces together to \"make for a well-paced album,\" he says. \"It's almost an antiquated idea, a project designed as an album, meant to be listened to from beginning to end.\"\nRecommended gigs: Flamenco Festival / Ancient Future\nPepe del Morao.

This time I'll focus on the animated and live action categories (playing as separate programs at Landmark's Shattuck Cinemas beginning on Friday, Feb. 10). If all goes as planned, the documentaries will get their moment in the sun next week.\nAnimation first, and as usual I'll start out with the films I consider least likely to win. Borrowed Time and Pearl both plow similar nostalgic ground: the former via an Old West tale of family loyalty and regret, the latter through a rose-tinted vision of music industry success. Borrowed Time's ugly CGI animation and flat story left me particularly unimpressed, while Pearl looks and sounds like a car commercial.\nIt wouldn't be the animated category without a Pixar representative, and this year it's Piper -- which might just as well have been entitled Totes Adorbs. Telling the story of a newborn seabird's struggle to achieve a measure of self-sufficiency, it's lovely to look at, completely delightful, and as much commerce as art.\nThe category's most daring entry is Blind Vaysha, an impressionistic examination of the life of a young girl who sees the past through her right eye and the future through her left. The film suggests her inability to see things as they really are is a \"disability\" we all suffer from; should Blind Vaysha win it'll be the National Film Board of Canada's seventh Animation Oscar since 1977.\n\nAt 34 minutes in length, Pear Cider and Cigarettes is by far the longest of this year's nominees. Biographical in nature, the film looks at the life of a committed hell-raiser through the eyes of a friend hoping to save him from himself. Not suitable for children, Pear Cider and Cigarettes will screen last after a brief auditorium-clearing intermission; it's the clear favorite with Blind Vaysha and Piper coming up on the outside.\nA French-Algerian man receives a harsh citizenship interview in Ennemis InterieursAs usual, length is more uniform in the live-action category - of the five nominees, only one clocks in at less than 25 minutes and the longest is half an hour. The shortest film, Timecode, runs a brief ten minutes and its shallow story of dancing parking attendants won't win it any friends among Academy voters.\nMy major concern about Sing (Mindenki) was whether or not it would be worse than last year's similarly titled musical cartoon, which I suffered through at the behest of a young relative over the holiday season. Happily, it's better: there are no singing animals, just singing Hungarian youngsters eager to send their over-competitive teacher a pointed message. It's the sort of film Britain's Children's Film Foundation churned out in the 1970s - which, if you're wondering, is a good thing.\nThere are two love stories in the running: Switzerland's La Femme et le TGV, featuring a lovely performance by Jane Birkin as a lonely woman whose long-distance relationship with a railway employee is all for naught, and Denmark's Silent Nights, in which a Salvation Army volunteer falls for a penniless Ghanaian immigrant. Both films are absurd and unbelievable (are there still such chocolate box villages in the Swiss Alps?), but Silent Nights' ability to tug at liberal Hollywood heartstrings probably moves it into award contention.\nHead and shoulders above the rest is Ennemis interieurs (Enemies Within), in which a French-Algerian man's 1996 citizenship interview rapidly turns into an interrogation. Written and directed by newcomer Selim Azzazi, it offers trenchant and timely commentary on loyalty, patriotism, nationalism, racism, and Islamophobia -- and should be this year's winner.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Big Screen Berkeley: Academy Award-nominated short films", "Tags": "['Big Screen Berkeley', 'Movies']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'Movies']", "Natural Language Location": "Landmark\u2019s Shattuck Cinemas", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.868723", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "247606", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.268026", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/09/big-screen-berkeley-academy-award-nominated-short-films/", "Author": "John Seal", "Date": "2017-02-09T09:30:26-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Untitled, c. 1970; screenprint on paper; 14  7/8  x 22 in.; collection of Lincoln Cushing/Docs Populi ArcTimes of political and social turbulence often foster innovative and creative forms of expression.

During those years, the spirit of idealism, mind-expansion, political resistance, new technologies, and electrifying music strongly shaped art, architecture and design, and affected society as a whole. The influence of that period resonates soundly today.\nWhile reducing the era to objects is a tough assignment, Hippie Modernism: The Struggle for Utopia effectively displays about 400 well-researched examples, including installations, photographs, fiber art, books, magazines, posters, film and furniture, with about 80 images augmenting the show in Berkeley (it was originally curated by the Walker Art Center of Minneapolis). Efforts have been made to present mixed media from various countries and to include the full range of the artistic and technological efforts of the era.

Photo: David AllenAurora's outstanding production of Tom Stoppard's award-winning 1982 play, The Real Thing, has already been extended because of early ticket demands. And it's no wonder. Although the celebrated British playwright is known for his intellectually fascinating dramas (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, Arcadia, Coast of Utopia, and his recent problematic The Hard Problem at ACT), The Real Thing combines intelligence, emotion and wit in a multifaceted play about love. An admirable, yet endearing, performance by Elijah Alexander as the playwright Henry successfully compliments Stoppard's masterful use of language.\nHenry, a stand-in for Stoppard himself, is a successful playwright who seems to find it difficult to express emotion in his life as well as in his theatrical productions. This deficiency is emphasized as The Real Thing begins with a play-within-a play, a scene from Henry's current comedy, House of Cards, in which a man's discovery of his wife's infidelity hardly affects his composure and eloquence. This artificial event foreshadows later scenes in The Real Thing with very different, and much more human, reactions to infidelity.\n\"I believe in mess, tears, pain, self-abasement, loss of self-respect, nakedness. Not caring doesn't seem much different from not loving.\" -- Tom Stoppard, The Real Thing.The two actors in the play-within-a play are Henry's wife, Charlotte (Carrie Paff) and his friend Max (Seann Gallagher). Max is married to Annie (Liz Sklar), who is also an actor. Annie is involved in trying to free Brodie (Tommy Gorrebeeck), a political prisoner of sorts. Max learns that Henry and Annie are having an affair in an incident involving a handkerchief straight out of Othello.\nThe second act occurs after Annie and Henry have been married for two years. When Annie spends six weeks in Glasgow in a production of 'Tis Pity She's a Whore with her young, sexy co-star Billy (also Tommy Gorrebeeck), a jealous Henry ransacks their house searching for signs of Annie's infidelity, in stark contrast to the play-within-a play of Act One. Annie admits that, as a result of Henry's remoteness, she is emotionally, although not physically, entangled with Billy. Yet the audience has watched the two rehearsing 'Tis Pity She's a Whore and it certainly seems as if they're having a physical affair. Or is this yet another illusion?\n\nThe theme of fidelity and love abounds as Stoppard dissects illusion and reality, art and life, emotion and loss, and the search for what is real -- The Real Thing. By the end of the play, Henry's persona is transformed from his lessons in love from the three women in his life, Charlotte, Annie and his teenaged daughter, Debbie (Emily Rodosevich).\nBilly (Tommy Gorrebeeck) and Annie (Liz Sklar) rehearse 'Tis Pity She's a Whore in Aurora Theatre's The Real Thing. Photo: David AllenTimothy Near's direction (\"Master Harold\" ... and the boys) neatly maintains the pacing and panache of the play. The cast, all experienced actors, led by Elijah Alexander, with some fine performances, including Liz Sklar's Annie, Carrie Paff's Charlotte and Emily Rodosevich's supporting role as Debbie, are up to the complicated task of performing a play by Tom Stoppard. And there are some nice touches to warm the production and keep it lively, such as lots of great old rock-and-roll music heard in between scenes.\nAnd who can't love a playwright who knows that it was The Crystals, and not The Ronettes, who sang Da Doo Ron Ron?\nThe Real Thing runs through March 5 at the Aurora Theatre in downtown Berkeley.

Photo courtesy of Rickey Vincent.Moving from Los Angeles to Berkeley in 1996 meant experiencing all kinds of low grade culture shock, from acquiring an eye for reckless pedestrians to learning the art of layering clothes. Another early jolt came courtesy of the East Bay Express, where I spotted a listing for a Zigaboo Modeliste gig at Pier 23. Zigaboo Modeliste!? The rhythmic mastermind behind New Orleans funk phenomenon the Meters? The Godfather of Groove himself, playing a regular gig at a neighborhood joint? Yes, the prophet of funk seemed little honored in his adopted hometown, a situation that's changed too slowly in the proceeding decades.\nAshkenaz and Berkeley's Them People Productions kick off a rich spate of Black History Month programming Saturday with an evening devoted to Modeliste's music and contributions. The event opens with a conversation between Modeliste and Berkeley funk historian, professor, and KPFA host Rickey Vincent at 7:30 p.m., followed by a brief audience Q&A and a show at 8:45 p.m. featuring Modeliste's band with his longtime vocalist Kelly Jones, New Orleans-born bassist Blyss Gould, guitarists Timm Walker and Chris Rossbach, and Atta Kid keyboardist Max Cowan.\n\"These legends need to have their stories told,\" says Vincent, Berkeley High class of '79. \"It's a great opportunity for Ziggy to tell those stories. This format is kind of a new concept. The idea is that you think and then you dance.\"\nIt's difficult to overstate Modeliste's influence. His work translating various New Orleans street beats into an infinitely pliable rhythmic vocabulary made him one of the planet's most sampled drummers. A short list of artists who've borrowed his beats, often without permission, starts with Ice Cube, LL Cool J, NWA, Public Enemy, Salt-N-Pepa, Digital Underground, De La Soul, Beastie Boys, Naughty by Nature and Queen Latifa. More than laying a funk foundation for the hip hop nation, he expanded a lineage of innovative New Orleans drummers that extends from Baby Dodds and Zutty Singleton through Eddie Blackwell, Idris Muhammad and James Black.\n\n\"I think Zigaboo is one of the most influential drummers around from the '70s,\" New Orleans jazz trumpeter Nicholas Payton told me when I asked him about his  tune \"Zigaboogaloo\" from his 1998 album Payton's Place (Verve). \"Some of the things he was doing on the drums had never been done before in R&B, or in any type of music for that matter. He just knew how to get right to the pocket at all times.\"\nAfter a decade off the scene following the messy dissolution of the Meters in 1977, Modeliste has engineered a productive second act from his home base in Oakland, building a small empire, complete with record label, educational videos, and publishing. It's a mark of the man that rather than becoming embittered after bad business decisions torpedoed the Meters at the height of their national visibility Modeliste decided to take on the music business on its own terms.\n\"When I started at 17 or 18, I saw a lot of great songwriters and artists who put a lot of great music in the world, who had a lot of success, but at the end of the day someone handled their publishing and wouldn't pay them,\" Modeliste told me in an interview several years ago. \"I could tell you a whole bunch of stories like that but I don't want to dwell there if I don't have to. I want to take the bull by the horns.\"\nModeliste didn't just lay down the grooves that defined the Meters' instrumental R&B hits such as \"Cissy Strut,\" \"Look-Ka Py Py\" and \"Chicken Strut.\" He co-wrote the tunes that established the Meters' signature sound, builkt on lean, muscular, and emphatically danceable rhythms that directly inspired neo-groove outfits such as Galactic, the Greyboy Allstars and Medeski, Martin and Wood.\nModeliste was still a teenager when he joined the band led by keyboardist Art Neville in 1966, with Modelists's cousin, bassist George Porter, Jr., and guitarist Leo Nocentelli. Working almost every night, the band quickly landed a gig as the house rhythm section for producers Allen Toussaint and Marshall Sehorn's Sansu label.\n\"We had this high-powered engine and we had six nights a week, every week playing in the Quarter to fine tune it,\" Modeliste said. \"When we started actually recording, we knew how to play together. We knew how to breath together.\"\nThe band turned out a slew of Top 40 R&B hits in the early '70s, and played on dozens of records by musicians such as Earl King, Betty Harris and Lee Dorsey. When they made the major label move to Reprise in 1972 it seemed like the band was on the verge of breaking through to a national audience.\nThe ambitious Wild Tchoupitoulas project, which expanded the group's sound with Neville brothers Aaron, Charles and Cyril and two members of the Mardi Indians, indicated the band was looking for new directions. Despite critical praise and high profile situations like recording with Paul McCartney and opening for the Rolling Stones on the band's 1975 world tour, too much bad blood had been accumulated.\n\"We did a lot in the short period of time in terms of contributing music,\" Modeliste said. \"But if you sign bad contracts from the very onset, there's no way that can be a healthy scene later. The group started blaming each other. It was a very tragic thing, because it was like a really beautiful ride while it was going, with so much potential.\"\nWhile Porter, Art Neville and Nocentelli refounded the band as the Funky Meters, and the Neville Brothers became more famous than the original Meters ever did, Modeliste moved to L.A. hoping to break into the studio scene. But with the ascendance of disco, his funky beats weren't in vogue and he stopped playing music for a while.\nBy the time he came to the Bay Area in the early '90s Modeliste was ready to get his own thing going. He gradually returned to band leading, and has gradually built up a devoted following. In New Orleans, he's an institution, returning regularly for gigs, particularly during the Jazz and Heritage Festival.\nRickey Vincent, who got his start as a journalist at Cal in the early 1980s writing the weekly column \"Below the Funk!\" for The Daily Californian, admits he didn't recognize Modeliste's full achievement \"until early 2000s, when some friends got all the Meters back together. That's when I realized that Ziggy was lead singer on a lot of those hits. You have to be running the show if you're the drummer and lead singer! He's as legendary as Clyde Stubblefield and deserves to have the cadre of well-traveled followers checking him out, and at Ashkenaz you're right up in front.\"\nVeteran drummer Vince Lateano introduces Jazz in the Neighborhood's new master class and jam series at the Back Room on Tuesday.Speaking of well-traveled drummers, Bay Area jazz mainstay Vince Lateano kicks off a new Tuesday night series at the Back Room, inaugurating Jazz in the Neighborhood's latest educational program. A non-profit group devoted to ensuring musicians receive fair wages, the organization also seeks to bring students together with veteran players.\n\"The concept came out of the years and years I spent with one foot in the classical world,\" says trumpeter and Jazz in the Neighborhood founder Mario Guarneri. \"I've been to a lot of master classes and I like the idea of student groups coming in and working these professionals. It's a fresh take on the traditional jam session.\"\nThe bi-monthly sessions open at 7 p.m. with a brief set by the pros, followed by two student combos performing in a master class format with critique and advice provided by the veterans. The evening concludes with a traditional jam where members of the audience are invited to sit-in.\nFunded in part by a grant from the Zellerbach Family Foundation and produced in collaboration with the California Jazz Conservatory, the sessions feature an array of ensembles, including bassist Marcus Shelby's trio (Feb. 21), vocalist Kellye Gray's quartet (March 7), guitarist Randy Vincent's trio (March 21), and percussionist John Santos's sextet (April 4).\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "An audience with the Godfather of Groove, and jazz master classes in the Back Room", "Tags": "['Berkeley music']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'Music']", "Natural Language Location": "Ashkenaz", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.88016", "Zip Code": "94702", "ID": "246763", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.295532", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/03/audience-godfather-groove-jazz-master-classes-back-room/", "Author": "Andrew Gilbert", "Date": "2017-02-03T08:00:02-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "\nIf you've been reading this column on a regular basis, you already know I'm terrible at handicapping the Academy Awards. In case you're new to Big Screen Berkeley, though, this just in: when it comes to Oscar predictions, I am really, really, jaw-droppingly awful. Random chance has a better record than I do.\nMy annual review of the Oscar-nominated short subjects will be coming next week, but while you anxiously await that particular exercise in futility and humiliation, here's a prediction in which I have (ahem) 100% confidence. Forushande (The Salesman, opening at Landmark's Albany Twin on Friday, February 3rd) will win the Best Foreign Language Film award next month, and if it doesn't, well, what else is new.\nIf The Salesman's pedigree as the latest film from acclaimed director Asghar Farhadi (whose masterful A Separation won the big prize in 2011) isn't enough to assure victory, surely the current political atmosphere will help it coast to a landslide. AMPAS voters are never shy about sending a message, and this is a situation tailor-made for Hollywood liberals anxious to cock a snook at Donald Trump.\nPrior to the imposition of our fascistic Muslim ban, (i.e., the prohibition of anyone entering the U.S. from seven countries, including Farhadi's country, Iran) The Salesman was already making headlines: in addition to earning an Oscar nomination and awards at Cannes, star Taraneh Alidoosti had announced she would not attend the Academy Awards in protest of Trump's blatant racism. Now, of course, she can't attend even if she wanted to - and neither can director Farhadi.\n\nAlidoosti plays Rana, an actress whose husband Emad (Shahab Hosseini) -  a high school literature instructor - is co-starring with her in a semipro production of Arthur Miller's 'Death of a Salesman'. With the couple's apartment building literally crumbling around them, they're compelled to leave their lodgings on short notice, and homelessness looms.\nLuckily for Rana and Emad, fellow thespian Babak (Babak Karimi) has an apartment available, but there's a catch: behind a locked door lie the possessions of the flat's previous tenant, a woman rumored by neighbors to have been working as a prostitute. At some point she's going to want her things back.\nShortly after moving in, Rana is attacked and injured by an intruder. Determined to identify and shame the assailant (who he suspects is a customer of the old tenant), Emad takes his inexpert detective skills to the streets of Tehran. Will sweet revenge be his?\nThough a certain amount of suspense is built into this pursuit, The Salesman is drama first, thriller distant second. Farhadi is much more interested in examining Rana and Emad's fraying relationship, which has suffered seemingly irrevocable damage in the wake of the assault.\nIranian films frequently subvert harsh government censorship by indulging in metaphor, and while it's possible to suggest this is also the case here - Rana's post-assault decision to become a shut-in could, perhaps, be considered a metaphorical comment on Iran's less than liberal approach to women's rights - it is not a particularly significant part of the story.\nInstead, The Salesman offers a sharply drawn analysis of the moral complexity and fallibility of human beings - victims and perpetrators alike. Deeply intelligent and courageously humanistic, only the curse of John Seal can prevent it from winning on February 26th.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Big Screen Berkeley: 'The Salesman'", "Tags": "['Big Screen Berkeley', 'Movies']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'Movies']", "Natural Language Location": "Landmark\u2019s Albany Twin", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.890451", "Zip Code": "94706", "ID": "246511", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.298158", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/01/big-screen-berkeley-salesman/", "Author": "John Seal", "Date": "2017-02-01T12:00:28-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Tony Taccone, who has served as the artistic director of Berkeley Rep for 22 years, will step down after the company's 50th season in 2018-2019 Photo: Berkeley Rep.Tony Taccone, who has served as the artistic director of the Berkeley Repertory Theatre for 22 of his 33 years there, will depart the company at the end of its 50th anniversary season in 2018-19, the organization announced today.\n\"It's been over thirty years, thirty amazing years,\" Taccone said in a press release. \"I've never been more excited about Berkeley Rep and the work that we're doing than I am right now.

Photo by Frank Leonard.Paul Yonemura wants everyone to know that he's back and raring to play. The Berkeley-raised jazz drummer spent nearly three decades teaching music in East Bay schools, from elementary kids to college students, but since retiring in 2013 he's started diving back into the freelance pool as a drummer for hire.\nDespite his hectic teaching schedule Yonemura never completely left the scene, and in recently years he's released a series of impressive albums featuring some of the finest musicians in the region. He celebrates the release of his new quartet session Kindred Spirits (Girod Records) Saturday at the California Jazz Conservatory.\n\"I'm just getting back into playing after teaching for 27 years,\" says Yonemura, who graduated from Berkeley High in 1969 and spent several productive years on the Los Angeles scene in the early '80s. \"I'll go down to 7 Mile House in Brisbane to sit in sometimes, but my career has kind of stalled. Some people think I'm still down in LA. I'm looking to stir a few things up.\"\nFeaturing bassist David Dunaway, pianist Frank Martin, and well-traveled alto saxophonist Rick Condit, Yonemura's new album Kindred Spirits should start fanning the embers. The quartet plays a fascinating book of material ranging from jazz standards like Herbie Hancock's \"Toys\" to melodically charged pieces by veteran players like trumpeter Dennis Dotson and Romanian pianist Ion Baciu.\n\nYonemura will be joined by the album's cast Saturday at the CJC, a daunting feat in itself as pinning down Martin for a gig can take serious temporal contortions. The Oakland pianist, producer, arranger and conductor is sought after by international jazz and pop luminaries, such as Stevie Wonder, Herbie Hancock, John McLaughlin, and Sting (whom he joined last month for the 20th year as assistant music director for his Carnegie Hall gala).\nThe four musicians met as college students back in the 1970s when they \"used to have a zillion jam sessions at my house in Oakland,\" Martin says. \"We started doing jazz gigs locally and then all went our separate ways. David and I kept playing full time. Rick was on tour with Stan Kenton, then he and Paul took teaching gigs.  I'd go to Paul's schools for years and do workshops, especially at El Cerrito High. When we get together now it's like family. We pick up where we left off. You know what kind of stories they're going to tell musically, so there's an ease in playing together.\"\nPaul Yonemura, photo by Kandice Chandler.The youngest of three children born into a prominent Japanese-American family, Yonemura had to contend with two academically gifted older sisters while growing up. Music provided an alternative route, and he eventually won grudging support from his father, immigration attorney Masatatsu \"Mas\" Yonemura, who was finishing his law degree at Boalt in December 1941. While Mas's parents and sisters spent the rest of World War II in internment camps after President Roosevelt's notorious Executive Order 9066, he joined U.S. Army's Military Intelligence Unit as a linguist.\nPaul's love affair with the drums was sparked by a family friend, long-time Berkeley resident George Yoshida, a tenor saxophonist and teacher who went on to write about his experience playing jazz in internment camps in his 1997 book Reminiscing in Swingtime: Japanese Americans in American Popular Music, 1920-1965.\nPaul had taken piano lessons as a child, but he was already a teenager when he found himself captivated by a drum kit in Yoshida's living room. \"I was standing there staring at it and he said 'Are you interested in learning how to play those?'\" Yonemura recalls. \"I said 'Yes, but I'm too old.' He said, 'It's not too late,' and hands me an old pair of drum sticks and a method book. 'Give it a try.' Without that I would have been lost.\"\nHe learned a vast number of show tunes singing in George Felker's Willard Middle School glee club (when the group's pianist was future music historian and New York City cabaret mainstay Peter Mintun). The East Bay garage band scene was exploding in the mid-60s, and Yonemura played every day, while getting turned on to soul and R&B by his Berkeley High classmates.\n\"The only problem was that the Berkeley High campus was very segregated, and the audiences were too,\" he says. \"The black students listened to certain kinds of music, and white students listened to certain kinds of music. The Asian students were more on the black side. I listened to everything. Black friends turned me on to music you'd never hear on Top 40.\"\nIn the late '60s, the Berkeley Jazz Festival provided exposure to the entire history of jazz drumming, from New Orleans patriarch Zutty Singleton to modern jazz pioneers Max Roach, Roy Haynes, and Tony Williams. He spent a year at SF State, where the highlight was taking improvisation classes with saxophone great John Handy, and then headed east to Boston's Berklee College of Music.\nWhen Yonemure returned to the Bay Area after graduating in 1974 he slowly established himself as a freelancer while also teaching privately. He landed a breakthrough gig in 1976 when he, Dunaway, and guitarist Steve Erquiaga hooked up with accordion virtuoso Art van Damme at Roland's, a jazz spot in the Marina. It was trial by fire, but he was up to the challenge of van Damme's searing tempos and ended up playing a long-running annual gig with him.\n\"From the first tune we knew we were in the tiger's den,\" Yonemura says. \"He didn't kill us the first set, but he liked those flagwaver tempos. On the third set he called 'Cherokee' and it was about the tempo of Woody Herman's 'Caledonia.' That was the first time being reviewed by the Chronicle, by John Wasserman, and we sold out all the shows.\"\nOther musicians took note too, and by the end of the year, he was working constantly while continuing to teach privately. After a four-year stint in LA, he returned to the Bay Area and took a position teaching music at El Cerrito High, responsibilities that curtailed his playing career. His passion for working with young musicians is evident when he talks about his students, like trumpeter/keyboardist Stephen Bradley, an El Cerrito High alum who has spent some two decades touring and recording as a member of No Doubt.\nOne reason why he connects with students so well is that he approaches music as a perpetual student himself. Already a formidable player, Yonemura still considers himself a work in progress.\n\"Paul plays everything, but jazz is his home ground, and technically he's fantastic,\" Frank Martin says. \"That's one of the strengths, his ability to swing really well, and tempo has never been an issue, so he's fun and exciting to play with. But I love the fact that he's open to learning. The last recording session he had a former student come and give him guidance on how to play certain things. Not every musician would be open to that, letting ego go away. It's a positive that many of us don't have, including myself. He's matured to the point where he's open to learning more. He's going to get a lot better now that he's back to playing.\"\nRecommended gigs\nSpeaking of Berkeley High alumni, trumpeter Erik Jekabson celebrates the release of his fantastic new album A Brand New Take at the California Jazz Conservatory on Friday (full disclosure: I wrote the liner notes).

The film I originally intended to review this week had its release date pushed back (you'll read about it next week instead), so another subject was needed tout de suite - and Tenemos la Carne (We Are the Flesh, opening at the Roxie Theatre in San Francisco on Friday, January 27th), was conveniently available to fill the void.\nI've been writing quite a bit about the recent mini-renaissance of Mexican cinema, so (convenience aside) this south-of-the-border production seemed like a perfect fit for Big Screen Berkeley - and indeed, it shares much in common with such films as The Incident and Bleak Street, all of which take place within vaguely recognizable, not-quite-surreal-but-almost alternate realities.\nIn other respects, however, writer-director Emiliano Rocher Minta's film strays far from the cozy comfort zone of contemporary art-house cinema. Giving the envelope an almighty nudge (and probably knocking it off the table altogether), We Are the Flesh is - please pardon the indelicate but accurate term - a disturbing and challenging mindfuck laced with sexually explicit scenes that would have earned it an 'X' rating in the old days (as well as 'XXX' hype in newspaper advertising).\nThe story, such as it is, revolves around a middle-aged hermit (A Monster with a Thousand Head's Noe Hernandez) and the two young adults (Maria Evoli and Diego Gamaliel) who stumble into his warehouse lair. Something, it seems, has gone terribly wrong in the outside world (though precisely what is neither examined nor explained at any point, even when 'reality' itself is ever so briefly glimpsed); the man now spends his time cooking bizarre, unappetizing stews and constructing a womblike cave fashioned from wood and an apparently endless supply of packing tape.\n\nHe's also sexually frustrated, and the young couple's arrival triggers his long dormant libido. Though not the primary focus of the film (there's no sex at all for the first thirty minutes or so), this is the part of the film that (to the extent that people talk about movies anymore) people are going to talk about. It is transgressive, it leaves next to nothing to the imagination, and it will probably make you, as it did me, rather uncomfortable.\nWhile I wouldn't consider We Are the Flesh pornographic in the traditional sense, it is most certainly (as the Roxie's promotional material deems it) \"not for the squeamish.\" However, if you can cope with the film's many challenging images (not all of them sexual in nature), there's a great deal to recommend here: astonishing set pieces, impressive cinematography that seesaws back and forth between visions of abject filth and ravishing beauty, and a soundtrack featuring some mysteriously wonderful Spanish-language pop songs.\nSo, no, this is no ordinary dirty picture. Imagine, if you can,  the sort of film David Cronenberg might have made if he'd been tasked with producing an adult version of Zabriskie Point - and if that sounds appealing (or repulsive), proceed accordingly.\n \n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Big Screen Berkeley: 'We Are the Flesh'", "Tags": "['Big Screen Berkeley']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'Movies']", "Natural Language Location": "Roxie Theatre in San Francisco", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.764837", "Zip Code": "94103", "ID": "245751", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.421921", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/01/25/big-screen-berkeley-flesh/", "Author": "John Seal", "Date": "2017-01-25T09:00:10-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Ofra Daniel leads an ensemble cast of international artists in the world premiere of Love Sick. Photo: Cheshiredave CreativeA rare world premiere musical in Berkeley, Love Sick is the impassioned fable about a woman's erotic love affair and the price she pays for it. But Love Sick defies classification as a typical musical. Its text is primarily the love poetry of the ancient Hebrew text, The Song of Songs, yet it is distinctly modern in its original international music and creative movement and dance.\nGifted writer, adaptor, co-music creator (with talented Lior Ben-Hur) and star Ofra Daniel (Edges, Kassit in Tel-Aviv, Secrets Behind Closed Doors) first transports the audience to modern day Tel Aviv. We meet her character, Tirzah, as an old and mad woman whose only spoken words are words of love. The remainder of the play shifts to ancient Jerusalem where we learn of the origin of Tirzah's love sickness. Young Tirzah is married to an older fisherman whose entire being seems to be imbued with the odor of his catch. Eventually, lonely Tirzah falls under the spell of an anonymous lover. Tirzah's transformation from a lonely woman to an animated sensual being is stunning.\nThe enchanted Middle Eastern and flamenco music (music director Yuval Ron) and voluptuous dance are vital and spectacular aspects of this 80-minute experience. The talented Ali Paris, who has performed with a multitude of stars including Alicia Keys, Quincy Jones and Ashton Kutcher, beautifully plays the qanun, a rare 76-string zither, while the rest of the terrific musicians and the four singers who act as the Women of Jerusalem are all inspired.\nJointly produced by Berkeley's Jewish Circle Theatre, in association with John Gertz Productions, Love Sick is ably directed by the accomplished Christopher Renshaw, who has directed productions from the Royal Opera House to Broadway. The Osher Studio, set up as a thrust stage, with seating on three sides of the theatre, is intimate and well-designed by Erik Flatmo, with a stark tree trunk in the rear and several crates that serve as moveable furniture and props.\n\nLove Sick's plot is a tad confused and seems a bit of an afterthought when compared with the music and movement, although it's just enough to keep the audience's interest in seeing the play to its surprising conclusion. It's the talent of the cast and musicians that makes Love Sick very special, especially Ofra Daniel, a bundle of energy and sensuality with a beautiful singing voice.\nA play title with \"sick\" in it gives critics easy opportunities to skewer it with pun-filled jabs, but Love Sick is so enchanting and engaging that I can't use any of them.

All the players performed on Nightshade (except Feiszli, who engineered and mixed the album), a project that reflects the high level of creativity that's coming out of the vocal program.\n\"It's a locus over there,\" Claburn says. \"I got to know some as professors, some as collaborators in vocal performance classes. I walked into audition for the program and I met Matt. I knew who he was and I'd seen him play, so it was like, wow! I know he's going to make me sound good.

She always loved to sing, but it wasn't until she had her first child that she started to consider the possibility of pursuing that passion.\n\"I was working at KQED as a unit manager and I enjoyed it, but I never felt like it was my calling or anything,\" she says. \"Everything changes with a kid. I stepped back and thought if I could do anything with my life, what would it be? I want to sing jazz. It's easy to say follow your dream, but it's hard to do.\"\nShe started vocal studies with Raz Kennedy, who turned her onto the Jazzschool (which was rechristened as California Jazz Conservatory). Laurie Antonioli was in the process of attracting a powerhouse pool of faculty for the CJC's jazz vocal program, and Claburn plunged in head first. Her work ethic and burgeoning creativity was recognized in the fall of 2010 when she earned the CJC's Mark Murphy Vocal Scholarship, an award given to a singer who \"demonstrates exceptional creativity and artistic promise.\" She earned a Bachelor of Music from the Conservatory, and in 2015 she joined the faculty herself.\nRather than rushing to put out an album, she took her time and honed the songs and arrangements on Nightshade, a consistently captivating program that focuses on her originals. The album opens with the surging \"Lionheart,\" a song inspired by her younger daughter, \"a fierce little thing,\" Claburn says. \"That driving sound is inspired by John Coltrane/McCoy Tyner sound of the 1960s.\"\nShe puts a fresh spin on \"Skylark,\" romps through the hoary lament \"After You've Gone,\" and digs into Bill Evans exquisite harmonies on \"Turn Out the Stars\" (lyrics by Gene Lees). But she's at her most impressive setting lyrics to existing jazz compositions, like \"Bird on a Wire,\" which is based on Pat Metheny's \"Timeline\" (a piece introduced on Michael Brecker's album Time Is of the Essence).\n\"Mike Clark brought that to my attention and said you should write lyrics to it,\" Claburn says. \"It's from one of Brecker's last albums, and Pat Metheny very graciously granted permission to use it.\"\nOne of my favorite tracks is \"Infinite Wisdom,\" Claburn's version of Duke Ellington's classic \"Echoes of Harlem.\" She was riding on BART when the song came up on her iPhone shuffle and \"Cootie Williams had me at the first note,\" she recalls. \"I thought this could be cool with lyrics. I was re-reading Langston Hughes at the time and borrowed the first line of his poem 'Acceptance.' 'God in his Infinite wisdom did not make me very wise.' I cleared it with his publisher and used that as a springboard for a song about betrayal and going back to Harlem.\"\nThe Dynamic Miss Faye Carol continues her Sunday residency at the Back Room.While Claburn is a relatively new face on the scene, several veteran vocalists continue to set a dauntingly high standard. The dynamic Miss Faye Carol continues her Sunday residency at the Back Room backed by pianist Joe Warner. Carol can croon soul and standards, scat hurtling bebop lines and deliver torch songs with scorching intensity, and everything she does is steeped in the blues. She's mentored some of the finest improvisers to come out of the East Bay, including piano great Benny Green and saxophonist/drummer Howard Wiley.\n \nHouston-based Jacqui Sutton makes her Berkeley debut Friday at Back Room, an exuberant performer, she has crafted a singular sound combining jazz and bluegrass \"with other influences creeping in as the mood takes me,\" she says.

Despite taking its knocks since the 1950s, the theory has left a permanent mark on cinematic criticism and appreciation, and no film writer can ignore it --even if they don't agree with it.\nBerkeley Art Museum Pacific Film Archive's current series On Dangerous Ground: The Cinema of Nicholas Ray is predicated on the efficacy of the theory - and it would be hard to argue against the stylistic and thematic consistency of Ray's work when comparing the evidence seen in They Live By Night (previously featured in the Archive's 2015 series, The Cinema According to Victor Erice, and screening at 2 p.m. on Sunday, Jan. 22), and in one of his best and most challenging features, Knock on Any Door, screening at 6 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 21, and again at 4:15 p.m. on Sunday, Jan. 22.\nA poster child of sorts for the socially conscious 'problem pictures' of the immediate post-war years, Knock stars Humphrey Bogart as Andrew Morton, an attorney whose previous experience defending young tough Nick 'Pretty Boy' Romano (John 'future husband of Bo' Derek) has left him feeling once bitten, twice shy.\nRomano, charged with the back-alley shooting death of a police officer, and desperate to beat the rap (and insistent about his innocence), practically begs Morton to take his case. Reluctantly, Morton signs up despite the long-term damage it may do to his career.\n\nHis search for exculpatory evidence begins on Skid Row, where Ray isn't shy about recording the travails of the city's drunks and down-and-outers. Men sleep slumped in doorways; others drink their lives away in pool halls. Knock on Any Door has the look and feel of a Walker Evans photograph or a Nelson Algren story, anticipating Otto Preminger's The Man With the Golden Arm by half a decade.\nAs in They Live by Night, the story partially revolves around the relationship between its protagonist and his ill-starred but loyal wife, here played to perfection by Allene Roberts (still with us at 88!). Roberts had previously portrayed a similar character opposite Edward G. Robinson and Rory Calhoun in Delmer Dave's unique melodrama The Red House (1947), and her star-crossed performance here is particularly poignant.\nOne of Knock on Any Door's most refreshing aspects is its willingness to put Nick's fate largely in the hands of his friends Juan (Pepe Hern) and Jim (Davis Roberts). Juan is Hispanic, Jim African-American; both roles are played straight and avoid the racial stereotyping that would have defined their characters prior to and during World War II.\nBest of all, Knock on Any Door refuses to play by the rulebook. Not only does the film push the envelope as far as it could have been pushed in 1949 (how did screenwriters Daniel Taradash and John Monks, Jr. thread the Breen Office needle and get the word 'prostitute' approved not once, but twice?), it's a film with a genuine final reel surprise up its sleeve.

Photo: Courtesy artistsMiriam Peretz and Rachel Valfer grew up together in Berkeley, shared an apartment as students in Jerusalem, and have reunited in the East Bay, drawn by an enduring friendship and passion for the culture of Sephardic Jewry.\nThey premiere their new collaboration Madre: The Ladino Project 7 p.m. Sunday at Freight & Salvage, a vivid reimagining of the music and dance that spread across the Mediterranean following the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492.\nFeaturing Peretz's choreography and Valfer's sumptuous vocals and deft guitar work, the Ladino Project brings together some of the region's most illustrious musicians exploring Arabic, Balkan and Near Eastern music, including Eliyahu Sills on bass and ney (Turkish end-blown reed flute), Dan Cantrell on accordion and other instruments, and Faisal Zedan and Tobias Roberson on Middle Eastern percussion.\nComprised of Old Spanish with vocabulary drawn from Turkish, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic, Ladino is a language that has survived multiple diasporas, with a rich tradition of songs. As the project's name suggests, \"Madre\" focuses on music associated with women, rather than masculine ballads known as romansas.\n\n\"I've always loved the music and poetic heritage of Ladino tradition,\" says Valfer, who graduated from Berkeley High in 1992. \"Even in high school I was singing this stuff. What's really interesting to me are the cantigas, the oral song tradition about the experience of womanhood, mothers singing to a baby, a maiden concerned about finding the right partner. They're kitchen and cooking songs, and songs about growing old and dying.\"\n\nWhile Valfer has a well-documented body of music to explore, Peretz faces a very different creative challenge. As a particularly fragile and hard to document art form, dance didn't survive the Spanish expulsion, and whatever traditions evolved in the dispersal have dissipated in the diaspora.\n\"There is no Ladino dance tradition,\" says Peretz, Berkeley High class of '94. \"In Jewish music culture there's just not much of a dance tradition. It was lost. They adapted into whatever culture they were living. So not so much reconstructing a tradition as constructing one, based on the many cultures that Ladino pulls together. Spanish, Turkish and also my own creative voice and contemporary movements.\"\nPeretz is uniquely prepared for this creative journey, by both birth and experience. Her father hails from a Moroccan Sephardic family, and her mother's Polish family traces their origins back to Spain. Her parents met in Israel, where she was born, but after they divorced her mother Estelle Frankel moved to Berkeley to open a practice as a psychotherapist (and to teach Jewish mysticism).\nUpon graduating Berkeley High, where she studied dance, Peretz moved back to Israel and spent years traveling around the Middle East, Spain, North Africa and Turkey \"on search to find a voice in dance that felt like my own, where I could express myself,\" she says. Dividing her time between Berkeley and Israel, she's been a principal dancer with Tel Aviv's Inbal Ethnic Dance Theater and served as principal dancer, choreographer, lead instructor and assistant artistic director of the Bay Area's Ballet Afsaneh (among other Bay Area companies).\nShe distills a lot of her far-flung knowledge at Berkeley's Mahea Uchiyama Center for International Dance on Feb. 17-20, when Nava Dance Art Sanctuary presents \"Sacred Dance of the Silk Road,\" an intensive introduction to Peretz's technique, choreography, improvisation and group ritual.\nValfer came to singing much later than Peretz found herself through dance. She studied oud for a while in Israel, but focused more on Ladino, immersing herself in the language for several years taking graduate courses at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Singing songs in Ladino led to music in Arabic and Azeri, \"and the more I did it the more good feedback I got,\" she says. \"Singing fully came to the forefront as I learned how to produce sound in a certain way.\"\nPeretz and Valfer's paths continued to cross, and as \"she was diving in deep studying music, I was falling in love with Middle Eastern culture and studying flamenco,\" Peretz says. \"We have a long history. We played music together, and created folkloric suites together in Jerusalem. It's very meaningful to be working together 20 years later. We've continued on that path, perfecting and going deeper.\"\nBack in Berkeley, she started to look for musicians to collaborate with, a quest that brought her to Za'atar, a group devoted to the music of Mizrahi peoples (Jews who hail from Arab countries). It's where she met Eliyahu Sills, who became her husband and co-founder of the Qadim Ensemble, a fascinating group with Faisal Zedan on Arabic percussion and Geri Hegedus on saz, Persian setar, and oud.\nMadre: The Ladino Project, featuring Miriam Peretz, Rachel Valfer, Faisal Zedan, Dan Cantrell, and Eliyahu Sills.

We can try to be true to the harmonic schemes that would have been natural, but we don't want to bind ourselves to being authentic.

Accordingly, they've determined that my very first review of 2017 should be for Neruda, a biopic opening at Landmark's Shattuck Cinemas on Friday, Jan. 13.\nBefore watching this film, my knowledge of poet Pablo Neruda was about as shallow as it gets. Beyond knowing he was a left-wing South American versifier who died under mysterious circumstances, I couldn't have told you anything about his life or work.\nI know a bit more now: in addition to being a communist poet beloved by the Chilean people, Pablo Neruda was also a senator and libertine forced to flee his native land during a post-war anti-leftist crackdown. Further periods of his life remain unexamined in director Pablo Larrain's film, as Neruda is set entirely during 1948 and early 1949 (though a special cameo appearance is made by a young army officer named Augusto Pinochet).\nA quick post-screening perusal of Neruda's Wikipedia entry suggests that, while Guillermo Calderon's screenplay is a broadly accurate representation of his trip into exile, it also takes considerable liberties with some of the details. It is here that the film departs from standard biopic tropes, entering the realm of irreality via the character of Oscar Peluchonneau.\n\nThe entirely fictional Peluchonneau (Gael Garcia Bernal, sporting a moustache that makes him look like a spiv selling silk stockings in Soho to war-weary British women) is the police detective assigned the task of capturing Neruda (Luis Gnecco, who bears an uncanny resemblance to the lumpy Nobel-prize winner). Tireless and obsessive, Peluchonneau is ready to follow our hero to the ends of the Earth - or at least, to the ends of the mountainous passes through which he must make his escape to Argentina.\nBernal's performance suggests he knows there is something of the fantastical about his character. Playing Peluchonneau as more Raymond Chandler private dick than Jack Webb just the facts ma'am incorruptible cop, he brings a broad, almost comedic touch to the role. Pushing things to the limit, Bernal almost tips over into self-parody, especially during some particularly silly scenes of him riding a motorbike (let's just say he rode a hog better in The Motorcycle Diaries.)\nThough cinematographer Sergio Armstrong tends to overdo things with a hyperactive Steadicam during the film's first hour, his work calms and improves in the later going. This is in part thanks to the stunning natural beauty of the snowy Chilean mountains, which provide Neruda with unexpected echoes of Sergio Corbucci's classic winter-set spaghetti western, Il Grande Silencio (The Great Silence).\nIn sum, Neruda's fictive transgressions allow it to avoid the plodding recreations of the average biopic. Its release also comes at a time when accusations of treason and fellow-traveling are flying freely around these United States, lending the film relevance Larrain and Calderon surely didn't intend or anticipate. Accordingly, it feels oddly contemporary.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Big Screen Berkeley: 'Neruda' -- A historic film with contemporary resonance", "Tags": "['Big Screen Berkeley']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'Movies']", "Natural Language Location": "Landmark\u2019s Shattuck Cinemas ", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.868723", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "243990", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.268026", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/01/11/big-screen-berkeley-neruda-historic-film-contemporary-resonance/", "Author": "John Seal", "Date": "2017-01-11T14:46:27-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "UC Berkeley Sociologist Arlie Hochschild in her living room. Photo: Daphne WhiteBerkeley sociologist Arlie Hochschild -- author of the best-selling book Strangers in their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right -- wrote her first book when she was nine years old. You could think of Colleen the Question Girl as a prequel to Strangers in their Own Land, which tries to make sense of why Trump supporters in Louisiana's 'cancer alley' feel loyal to the oil companies who pollute their air and water, while despising the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\"Why don't bears have horns?\" \"Why aren't zebras plaid?\" \"Why are some houses so big and others so small?\" Hochschild wrote in her first book. Even as a child -- and Hochschild readily admits that Colleen was modeled after herself -- she was asking difficult questions. \"It was about a little girl who was trouble to the adults in her life,\" she said. \"She's a little radical, and she was always trying to get her father's attention.\" Colleen starts out as a girl who asks too many questions but, eventually, she becomes the town's question girl. \"Question-asking spread all over town,\" the young Hochschild wrote. \"And over the years to come, questions flew out of Colleen's dreams into a wind that blew all around the world.\"\nAs it turns out, Colleen -- first published in 1974 by the Feminist Press and now reprinted and available on Amazon -- was prescient. Hochschild started teaching at the sociology department at UC Berkeley in the 1970s, at a time when there were precious few female sociologists. From the get-go, she started asking the kinds of questions that were not on her male colleague's radar screen. Why is \"women's work\" less valued than men's work? What happens when traditional \"women's work\" (such as childcare and elder care) is outsourced to strangers? And, more recently, how can blue-collar workers be so blind about billionaires?\nHochschild revels in these seemingly intractable questions. In between Colleen and Strangers in their Own Land, Hochschild wrote several other groundbreaking books, including The Second Shift, The Outsourced Self, The Managed Heart and The Commercialization of Intimate Life: Notes from Home and Work. But her latest book has been her most successful yet: it has spent time on the New York Times bestseller list, and was a finalist for the National Book Award. It has been so popular that it was unavailable for three weeks before Christmas because Amazon could not keep it in stock. (Hochschild is still irritated about that.) \"I have written 10 articles since the book came out: I never imagined I'd be doing all this,\" she said.\n\nBut timing is everything and, once again, Hochschild was prescient. \"Five years ago, here in Berkeley, I began to sense a terrible divide,\" she told a gathering at the Hillside Club recently. \"Not because the left was becoming more left, but because the right was becoming more right.\" Look at a Republican such as President Eisenhower, she said. \"He was a great sponsor of public infrastructure. Reagan was for gun control. Goldwater's wife was one of the founders of Planned Parenthood. Nixon brought us the Environmental Protection Agency. And now we hear that the nominee to head the EPA is a climate-change denier.\"\nIn Louisiana, Hochschild -- who sheepishly told her interviewees she came from \"Bbbbbbb ... Berkeley\" -- encountered true Southern hospitality. She was served lots of sweet tea and gumbo. She was invited to family dinners and community barbecues and was taken out for leisurely boat rides on the (highly polluted) bayou.Hochschild began the research with one of her trademark questions: \"How is it that the poorest states in our country, with the worst levels of education, the worst health, the lowest life expectancy -- and states that take more aid from the federal government than they give back in taxes -- how is it these states revile the federal government? I didn't understand.\"\nShe was also called a \"communist,\" an \"environmental wacko,\" and a \"femi-Nazi\" by her subjects. \"Luckily, they always laughed after they said that,\" she recalled. But she added that, \"people in Louisiana were also concerned about the divide. They felt they were a fly-over state, and that they were considered uneducated and wrong-headed and Southern and redneck. They were glad I came down to see who they really were.\"\nHochschild began the research with one of her trademark questions: \"How is it that the poorest states in our country, with the worst levels of education, the worst health, the lowest life expectancy -- and states that take more aid from the federal government than they give back in taxes -- how is it these states revile the federal government? I didn't understand.\"\nLouisiana was the poster child for this paradox: in 2004, Hochschild says, it was the poorest state in the union, and 44% of the state budget came from the federal government. \"And they are very strongly Tea Party,\" she said. \"By the end of my journey, I discovered that they are enthusiastically for Donald Trump. For five years, I had been studying the dry kindling. When I went to New Orleans to see a Trump rally in 20016, I saw the match.\"\nHochschild has always been interested in studying feelings and not just data, so it's not surprising to hear her say that \"we need to understand who the Trump supporters are, why that vote makes sense to them -- without presuming they are deplorables.\" The people Hochschild interviewed felt \"culturally colonized [by liberal values] and marginalized. They felt like a minority group, that was unnamed and couldn't -- didn't -- want to name itself. They were victims, they felt, but couldn't claim victimhood.\"\nThey felt that Hillary Clinton's economic and trade policies would push them further back, while Trump told them, \"we're' making you great again, I am recognizing you, blue-collar people.\" These communities felt looked down upon as a region but also as a social class. \"There was a lot of despair and depression\" among Trump supporters, Hochschild said, \"and Trump was like an anti-depressant. He's very good at drilling down for anxiety and deploying it. He said, 'I will get you un-depressed.'\"\nBut how can a billionaire from Queens understand the situation of blue-collar workers in Louisiana? \"He's been watching it out of the corner of his eye for 25 years,\" Hochschild said. \"He watched [George W.] Bush put on a cowboy hat and pretend to be a cowboy,\" and he attempted a similar feat.\nDemocratic party policies, meanwhile, were not helpful to blue-collar workers, Hochschild said. \"Raising the minimum wage does not help blue-collar workers,\" she said. International trade agreements were not helpful to the people she interviewed, and government regulations sometimes made their lives more difficult rather than easier. \"The Democratic Party has relied on Silicon Valley for support, but paradoxically many of the interventions that will come out of Silicon Valley will put blue-collar people out of work,\" she said. She added that many public institutions actually benefit the middle class \"a lot more than the poor.\" In addition, she said, progressives don't want to see that \"some public things are not functioning well. Some regulations have gone haywire.\"\nArlie Hochschild and her husband Adam Hochschild, who is also a prominent author, have two granddaughters. Photo: Daphne WhiteAnd, though many Berkeleyans feared that five years of repeat visits to Louisiana would cause Hochschild to go native, exactly the opposite has happened: Hochschild moves right into Berkeley mode when she returns from her field work. \"Berkeley is my home,\" she says. \"It has allowed me to exhale, to take more chances, be more creative.\" And so, Hochschild now tells anyone who will listen that Berkeley needs to go back to its activist heyday to respond to the Trump phenomenon. \"We need to move on from despair and recover in the spirit of the '60s,\" she said at the Hillside Club.\nHochschild said that in these troubled times progressives need to engage in \"some peaceful and massive demonstrations. I think we do need to fight. I want to see a lot of '60s activism out there.\" Progressives need to fight -- and file massive lawsuits -- against any policies of a Trump administration that would hurt the environment, or civil rights, or women's rights, or other progressive values and principles, she said. \"We need a large vision, and we need to set up a loyal opposition.\"\nAt the same time, she said, progressives should engage with individual Trump supporters and try to find areas where we are in agreement. \"We need to stand up, assert our values, and have conversations. We need to reach out to Trump supporters who a mere eight years ago voted for Barack Obama. They aren't so far away, and we can't just hurl epithets at each other.\"\nHochschild, in fact, is still in conversation with her 'friends' in Louisiana. In fact, she is about to embark on another trip to the Bayou, this time with her son David Hochschild, one of five members of the California Energy Commission. David has a background in solar energy and works to promote renewable energy for the state of California. Hochschild's radical plan is to put David together with Mike Schaff, an ardent Tea Party member and Trump supporter, who is also a major character in Strangers.\nSchaff's house and community were basically destroyed when a 37-acre sinkhole opened up and swallowed up much of the neighborhood. Those houses that still stand, including Schaff's, are filled with dangerous levels of methane gas. This oil industry disaster could have been prevented, she says, with better regulation by both state and federal agencies, yet Schaff is vehemently opposed to regulation. (Read Hochschild's essay on Schaff.)\n\"I thought it would be good to get Mike together with my son,\" Hochschild says. \"You couldn't find two more different people. But my idea is to get them in Mike's boat and see whether people with such different political philosophies can find common ground on the environment.\" Hochschild plans to be a silent witness in that boat, recording the conversation.\nHochschild refers those who are interested in embarking on a Left-Right dialogue of their own to a new website called LivingRoomConversations.org. This site was founded by Joan Blades, a co-founder of MoveOn.org, who also appeared with Hochschild at the Hillside Club. Living Room Conversations provides a format for people from opposite sides of a variety of issues to seek common ground. The group will be launching another site called MisMatch.org in the near future, so people with different views from different geographic areas can begin online conversations, also to seek common ground.   \"I think we will be bigger and better\" for having these conversations, Hochschild said.\nEven though Hochschild is technically retired, she is already thinking about her next project. \"I'm thinking of going where global warming is really hurting people, but where there is a culture that promotes the idea that global warming is a myth,\" she said. \"I would like to meet these people and see what they think.\"\nTo see Hochschild's future speaking events, click here.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Arlie Hochschild: Looking for answers from Berkeley to the Bayou", "Tags": "[]", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'Books']", "Natural Language Location": "UC Berkeley", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.869861", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "243839", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.258765", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/01/11/arlie-hochschild-looking-answers-berkeley-bayou/", "Author": "Daphne White", "Date": "2017-01-11T09:47:15-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Berkeley author Shanthi Sekaran has set her new novel in her hometown. Photo: Daniel GrisalesLucky Boy, the affecting and resonant new novel from Shanthi Sekaran, tells the story of an immigrant from Mexico, Soli, whose infant son is taken in by an American family when Soli's undocumented status targets her for deportation. It is the second novel for Sekaran, who has lived in Berkeley for over a decade, and the author will be reading from the book at Mrs. Dalloway's on Wednesday, Jan. 11 at 7:30 p.m.\nLucky Boy is set in Berkeley, and told with warmth and empathy, but with a keen eye for the sometimes well-meaning delusions of the privileged. Kavya and Rishi want nothing more than to care for a child, but their loving embrace of baby Ignacio is inherently based on Soli losing her son. At points, the novel was such a punch in the gut that this reader had to periodically check on her own infant son as she read it. Sekaran does not simplify the people or the circumstances her characters find themselves in, and the complex questions raised by the novel linger long after the book ends.\nBerkeleyside met with Shanthi in a cafe in Berkeley, and we talked about the stories of deported parents that spurred her writing, the research it took to develop Soli as a character, and the multifaceted nature of \"the immigrant experience.\" \nI wanted to start by discussing the setting of your new novel, Lucky Boy. Did you always know that this story would be set in Berkeley?\n\nI started this in Berkeley from the very beginning of writing the novel. I've always had a lot to say about Berkeley. It's just one of those places that's very fertile for a writer. Often, in the past, I've had to get away from a place to write about it. For my first novel, The Prayer Room, I had to leave Sacramento to be able to think about it and write about it. But with Berkeley, there's always something going on that you can write about.\nThis story really works in Berkeley; I didn't want to set the story somewhere an undocumented immigrant might face widespread prejudice, or misunderstanding, or ignorance. I wanted a place that was socially and culturally diverse, that was liberal -- a place that could be hospitable to an immigrant and, specifically, to an undocumented immigrant.\nYou tell this story both from a local point of view and that of a newcomer. Kavya attended UC Berkeley, and is very much of this place - it's very normal to her to eat pizza on the median outside of The Cheese Board -- whereas Soli provides us the outsider perspective.\nI had to be very aware of what Kavya would notice about Berkeley, and what she wouldn't, and what would strike Soli first, what she would care about or appreciate.\nWhat are some of the elements of the city that you wanted to capture in this story?\nI wanted to capture the mix of the place, the mix of Berkeley. We're all on top of each other here. This isn't a suburb where you see your neighbor once every three days, when you're both pulling your SUVs out of your garages. This is a place where you have to deal with people on a moment to moment basis if you're going to go outside your door. So that puts Soli in a very dynamic and interactive place. I wanted her to have an intense experience with the world around her. I didn't want to have an immigrant story where my character stays in the house and is lonely. I wanted to populate her world.\nI also think that Berkeley is a very particular place in that it's filled with people with excellent intentions. People want the best for everyone: for immigrants, for nonimmigrants, for undocumented immigrants. But it's also a place of great privilege, and sometimes those two elements don't mix; sometimes people's good intentions blind them to their own insensitivities, and in the novel, Mrs. Cassidy [who hires Soli as a maid and nanny] is the personification of that.\nLucky Boy is Berkeley author Shanthi Sekaran's second novel.California, and Berkeley in particular, seem easy for writers to satirize, especially when approaching these places and their cultures with a critical eye. Was parody or simplification an approach you had to be careful not to fall into? \nI've lived here for so long that a simplification would be hard for me, because I know it for its complexity. I did want this novel to be somewhat of an homage to Berkeley. I love writing about the details of this town -- but I didn't want it to be a Woody Allen-style homage, making the setting of each of his movies the most beautiful, evocative image of that city that he can. I didn't want to stay on the surface. At the end of the day, I was telling the story of a woman's struggle in Berkeley, and the town had to come into that struggle as well.\nLike you, Kavya is an Indian-American woman living in Berkeley, which makes her experiences seem closer to home, on the surface. Did you face different challenges in writing such a familiar character and then also writing cross-culturally, from Soli's point of view?\nSoli is Mexican, and, at a certain point in writing her story, I realized I had no idea what I was doing. I have never lived in Mexico, and although I have known, and been friends with, Mexican people and people of Mexican descent in California, that's not the same. So a few months into writing the book, I hit a wall. I had made up this town for Soli, but I didn't know in my head what region it was in: I had no regional identifiers, I had no feel for where she was. I realized I had to get myself to Mexico and soak in some element of the reality of that country. I had the opportunity to stay at an artist's residency called Oax-i-fornia in a village just outside of Oaxaca, which was a huge gift to this story. That allowed me to give Soli a cultural identity, and a real home. Soli's hometown, Popocalco, is loosely based on my observations of this little town.\nKavya's Berkeley is very much my Berkeley. That came more naturally: the challenge there was more internal, to figure out her psychology. How I was going to get her from being a socially conscious, liberal woman to being a woman who could feel justified in taking someone else's child.\nDid learning about these contemporary struggles experienced by immigrants affect how you thought about the experience of your parents' generation coming to the United States, as represented by Kavya's mother Uma in the novel? \nIn terms of this particular novel, it was important to me to illustrate the difference in privilege between someone like Kavya, whose parents could stay through an academic, or job-related visa, and someone like Soli.\nGoing back a few years before this publication, I was getting lots of rejections - I went through a year or two of rounds of rejections, and at a certain point, I was just like, \"You know what, I'm just going to make all my Indian characters white, and then the book will sell\" -- a very cynical move. I half-jokingly told this to my agent, and she said, \"You can't do that.\" She pointed out something to me, which I hadn't fully realized, which is that this is a book about how different types of immigrants interact and have experience with immigration in different ways. I continued to develop the story from that angle, so you have Kavya and Rishi, and you have [the Silicon Valley titan and Rishi's boss] Vikram Sen, and you have Soli. That thread of thinking about privilege began to really inform the story.\nHas the raging anger and debate in last year's presidential race over the very idea of Mexican migrants living in the United States made you think differently about the stories that you're telling? This novel seems like an important story for this time, since it gives a voice, a face, a story, and a story to someone who otherwise would remain hidden.\nI wrote this story because it's a story that deeply interested and intrigued me. I couldn't have just written it because it was a hot issue; I couldn't have spent four or five years of my life working on that. It was primarily something that spoke to my heart and my mind, and that's why I started it. But as I researched the situation of undocumented immigrants, the issue grew bigger and bigger for me, and I realized what I had on my hands. And I also realized that it's a real privilege for me to be able to tell this story, because so many undocumented immigrants, especially people like Soli, in her circumstances, don't have the opportunity to sit down and write a novel. So this story was in my hands, and I had to be careful with it, treat it well, and do justice to it, make it full and real. As I was writing, the issue of undocumented immigrants grew and grew, and I wondered if at some point in my writing it would all get solved and I'd be writing a historical novel. But no -- it's still current, unfortunately.\nYou said this was really a story that spoke to your heart and your mind, and emotions are really at the heart of this novel - that's where I was really blown away. What were the emotions you hoped to capture?\nThe initial emotion that grabbed me was an intense curiosity. I'd heard about this Guatemalan woman [Encarnacion Bail Romero] whose child was being adopted away from her when she was being deported, and that was the first inkling I had of stories like Soli's. I couldn't stop thinking about this story. I wanted to know what was happening in the minds of the people involved, the mother and the adoptive parents, and I was very intrigued by the idea of a sort of love that could justify taking a child away from its willing and able mother. So, it was an exploration of love, and blindness, self-delusion - loving delusion is a big part of this novel.\nWere there questions about what parenting means that you wanted to clarify through writing this novel, or did those questions come up as these two stories intersect? It seems like definitions of motherhood are very much at stake.. \nThey became clearer as I wrote, although I didn't set out to investigate the definitions of motherhood. The underlying message of the two parallel stories -- and I don't know if I crafted this intentionally -- is that both of these women are mothers, and that calls into question the validity of taking one woman's child away to give it to another. I set up that parallel in order to raise a question, not really to answer a question.\nShanthi Sekaran will give a reading and sign books at Mrs Dalloway's, 2904 College Ave., Berkeley, CA 94705, on Wed.

Photo: Lori A. CheungJoe Lurie has spent most of his adult life interacting and engaging with other cultures and promoting cross-cultural understanding. As a young man, he served in the Peace Corps in Kenya, the beginning of his life of \"intercultural encounters.\"\nFor 20 years, Lurie was the executive director of the University of California's International House, whose mission is to \"foster intercultural respect and understanding for the promotion of a more peaceful world.\" Since his retirement, Lurie has been a teacher, intercultural trainer, and consultant. In 2106, he published a book drawing together all he had learned about understanding - and misunderstanding - one another - in the book. Perception and Deception: A Mind-Opening Journey Across Cultures. \nLurie will be discussing the book Jan. 14 at 3 p.m. at the North Berkeley Library. Berkeleyside caught up with Lurie to talk about his book.\nYou served as executive director of UC Berkeley's International House at the top of Bancroft Avenue for 20 years. I-House, as you put it, is \"one of the great multicultural institutions\" in the world with close to 600 residents from 80 countries and 25 states. It is now a landmark in Berkeley, but when it was proposed in 1928, many were opposed to its construction. Why? What were they afraid of? What happened? How did it finally get built?\n\nWhen the intended creation of International House Berkeley was announced to a segregated Berkeley in 1928, there was resistance to men and women living under one roof; hostility towards foreigners; and the notion that people of color would live with whites in an integrated setting was, to most, simply unthinkable. Many Berkeley landlords protested, fearing an influx of foreigners and a collapse of property values. There also was fear of miscegenation, then illegal in California. In 1929, at Berkeley's Veterans' Memorial Building,   approximately 1,000 people protested against racial integration in the proposed International House. Delilah Beasley, a Black reporter and columnist for the Oakland Tribune passionately defended the I-House concept to a disgruntled and disapproving audience.\nI-House founder Harry Edmonds chose Piedmont Ave. for the building because it was the home of fraternities and sororities which then excluded foreigners and people of color. By proposing the site there, Edmonds wanted to strike bigotry and exclusiveness \"right hard in the nose.\"\nThe I-House in 1930 with a Model T parked outside. Photo: UC BerkeleyIn August 1930, I-House opened, its construction supported by a gift from John D. Rockefeller Jr. In following years, I-House residents integrated the first fraternity at Cal and struck down restrictive covenants in the Berkeley Hills. During World War II, I-House was one of the very few institutions to oppose the internment of Japanese-Americans. And despite laws forbidding miscegenation in California, many of the first interracial marriages in the state were born at I-House.\nWhat inspired you to write Perception and Deception: A Mind-Opening Journey Across Cultures? What is its main message?\nWith the acceleration of globalization, I saw increasing misperception across cultures. Without preparation and context, many cross-cultural misunderstandings can have confusing, even dangerous consequences.\nFor example, why did once-friendly Afghan soldiers attack their NATO partners? They'd unintentionally broken an Afghan taboo against inquiring about female relatives. Why do many refugees traumatized by violence find Western \"talk therapy\" alienating? As a Syrian refugee confided: \"I can't share my painful, humiliating stories with a stranger.\" A South Sudanese refugee was diagnosed \"psychotic\" because she seemed to be talking to herself; her New York psychiatrist was unaware that in her world, conversing with ancestors is normal.\n And here at home, when a Singaporean computer programmer asks her American co-worker about her husband, the American woman is afraid to say she has a wife.\nAn Italian friend asked how my nephew was doing at Cal. \"He's in heaven,\" I answered. Lowering his eyes, my Italian friend said softly, \"I'm so sorry.\" Through his Catholic prism, he thought my nephew had died. And I realized that the pleasure I'd meant to express often could be misunderstood in other countries - even my own. That's why the title of one of my chapters is: \"Words That Conceal, Words That Reveal.\"\nWhile writing about misperceptions across cultures, I remembered my years as a Peace Corps volunteer in Kenya, where I misunderstood much of what I initially saw. While I was walking in the village where I lived, men held my hand - very unsettling for a heterosexual man. I later learned that throughout Africa and in parts of Asia and the Middle East, men hold hands without any suggestion of homosexuality.\nAs I wrote in my book, \"Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off, or the light won't come in.\"\nHow do our inborn cultural biases influence how we view things? Can you show us using the example of a cow (which also graces the cover of your book.)\nWildly contrasting values across cultures are symbolized by the cow I chose for the book cover. Does the cow represent: Dowry? Divine? or Dinner? For the Masai and many other ethnic groups in Africa and some other parts of the world, the cow is a \"dowry,\" a show of wealth. Among Hindus, the cow is considered \"divine,\" so sacred that it's often cared for in old age and eating beef is forbidden. How strange this taboo appears to many meat-eaters around the world who associate the cow with hamburgers, steak or ribs - a divine \"dinner.\" But for many Hindus consuming a holy cow for dinner would be a disgrace.\nIn your book, your chapter on International House is full of anecdotes of how people from different cultures misunderstand one another. Some of these tales, which you dub \"smashing stereotypes,\" are amusing, like the time one student was offended when Asian students slurped their soup noisily. He regarded it as rude whereas the Asian students saw it as an expression of their pleasure. In the end, the student ended up slurping his soup. Can you share some other examples?\nNadine, a graduate student frequently was asked what part of Africa she's from. When she answered, \"North London\" students were amazed. And in the Queens' English, she'd explained she's British and never has visited Africa.\nSome French students told me how disarming it was to meet a student from Texas who played Beethoven sonatas beautifully on the piano and discussed Jean Paul Sartre with ease.\nA PhD. student told me that I-House residents usually don't believe he's Turkish because he's blond and has green eyes. A third-generation Indian-American was often asked what part of India she's from. When she answered \"Boston,\" the common response: \"But where are you REALLY from?\" Many Asian-American students often express similar frustrations.\nThen there was a Chinese student who discovered his new roommate was African American from Chicago. He felt uncomfortable, even afraid after seeing US TV shows. A few days later, when he heard the American speak fluent Mandarin, he was shocked, enlightened.\nJoe Lurie served as executive director of the I-House for two decades. Here is is at a July 2015 alumni reunion on top of Memorial Stadium. Lurie is on the left in the bright blue shirt. The I-House is visible in the background. Photo: UC BerkeleyIn your book, you suggest that we all live in our own \"cultural ponds.\" What do you mean by that? \nA 4th-century Chinese poem asks, \"How shall I talk of the sea to a frog if he never has left his pond?\" Consider footprints on a toilet seat at San Francisco Airport. How many of us are startled, perhaps disgusted, to see this? Yet millions of people from different cultural upbringings squat to relieve themselves and so they understand why there are footprints. They wonder why anyone would even consider sitting on a toilet seat. Only when one leaves one's pond can both perceptions begin to make sense.\nWe live in a world that has been wrought small through jet travel, the internet, and the mobile phone. Do you think this will help multi-cultural understanding? Does the speed of communication carry its own risks?\nWith YouTube videos, Tweets and fake news instantly crossing cultures without context, it's essential to understand the actual meanings and intentions behind words and actions which seem abnormal or provocative.\nIn our hyper-connecting world, colliding cultures increasingly are causing misperceptions and misunderstanding. Some French see a Muslim woman in a burkini, a full-body swimsuit, as oppressed or a potential terrorist. Yet, the woman considers her burkini liberating because she can swim modestly.\nRecently a UC Berkeley student with a Spanish last name snidely was asked when she'd return to Mexico. Her angered response: \"I'm from Kansas and don't speak Spanish.\"\nIn the United States, English is our official language, there doesn't seem to be much emphasis on learning other languages or getting to know other cultures. Has this harmed our reputation in the world?\nBecause for so long we've remained geographically far from the rest of the world and because of our militarily and economic power, learning other languages hasn't been a priority. Even today it's possible, unlike most other countries, to earn a PhD in most US universities without ever having studied a second language.\nInternational visitors, businesspeople, and students often tell me they're shocked to discover how little most Americans know about their countries and languages. One Brazilian businessman recently told me an American asked if they have July 4th in Brazil. His response: \"Yes, of course. And we also have July 5th, 6th, and 7th as well!\"\nOur incoming president has vowed first to ban all Muslims, then he narrowed the bar to just those from \"problematic\" countries and he said that Mexicans are rapists, killers, and drug dealers. If you could talk face-to-face with Trump about this, what would you say? \nI'd ask him to consider how his overly generalized choice of words alienate Muslims abroad who've experienced the most violence and suffering at the hands of radical Islamic terrorists; and also how these words fuel fear and alienation among Muslim-Americans who have an important role in helping us all to keep our country safe. And I'd ask him to reflect on a Mexican proverb in my book: \"There is no one as blind as the one who does not want to see.\" And to remember a Yiddish proverb I cite: \"When one always drinks vinegar, one does not know anything sweeter exists.\"\n How do you think those who have lived at I-House have benefitted from the multicultural experience? \nIn spite of, or perhaps even because of wars, racism, and ideological conflicts, the encounters at I-House among residents from different cultural background often produce dramatic and unexpected new friendships.\nI recall a Muslim Berkeley student whose once friendly Christian -American dorm mates turned against her after 9/11. She moved to I-House thinking she'd be safe surrounded by supportive foreign students. Her hopes were shattered when she learned her roommate was an American Caucasian from Alabama. She feared sharing a room with a \"southern redneck racist.\" Soon she discovered her roommate was thoughtful and refined and a transformative friendship was born.\nSince not all of us can live in an I-House, what can we do to increase our understanding of people from other cultures?\nLiving with a family in another country as part of an educational exchange program frequently is mind-opening. Perhaps during this time of increasing polarization in the U.S., we should launch a domestic homestay and study exchange program in which people from different ethnic, economic, political, religious and racial backgrounds can discover their common humanity and the limitations of their perceptions.\nHow can we find out more about your book?\nI'm giving a book talk at the North Berkeley Library on Jan. 14 at 3:00 p.m. For an excerpt from the book, chapter themes and reviews, visit PerceptionAndDeception.com. It's in paperback and Kindle on Amazon, and e-versions at Barnes &Noble and Apple.\nThe book also will be featured in an intercultural course I'll be teaching in the Spring for UC Berkeley's Osher Institute for Lifelong Learning.\nFollow Berkeleyside on Twitter and Facebook or get the latest news in your inbox.

UC Berkeley cinemagraph: Stephen McNallyBy Anne Brice / UC Berkeley\nPictured above is UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra trumpet player Nick Antipa playing Beethoven's Leonore Overture No. 2 in Zellerbach Hall. The sound is rich, resonant, heroic. It's the sound of Zellerbach.\nBut the acoustics that make this sound possible didn't just happen. The sound has been created with an acoustic system of some 40 microphones and 140 speakers, all intricately placed throughout the hall. It's called Constellation by Berkeley-based Meyer Sound.\n\nConstellation allows you to digitally create multiple environments in one space by changing the length of reverberation, strength or loudness. It can even change the perceived height and width of a room.\n\nSo, if you close your eyes, it can transport you to a big, open space like a cathedral. Turn off the reverb and it becomes a normal stage. Antipa says the difference is striking.\n\"It makes me feel very comfortable. Like playing is fun and easy, so I can really just think about the piece of music that I'm doing. Whereas if I'm in someplace that feels like a closet, then I hear every little mistake.\"\nRead more about Meyer Sound on Berkeleyside.\nMatias Tarnopolsky is the director of Cal Performances. He says when he was first told about Constellation, he was deeply suspicious of any acoustic system -- one that used unnatural means to create a sound -- especially in a concert hall. But he was soon convinced.\n\"I went from being a skeptic to being a convert to being an advocate,\" says Tarnopolsky. \"You can have everything from a solo violinist to a full symphony orchestra and chorus sounding absolutely glorious.\"\nConstellation in Zellerbach Hall uses more than 140 small speakers discreetly placed throughout the concert hall and some 40 tiny microphones hanging from the ceiling to create its signature sound. Photo: Courtesy of Cal PerformancesIn 2006, Zellerbach was the first space in the world to have Constellation installed. At first it was just temporary, but in 2009 the system became permanent, a decision that Tarnopolsky says has transformed the hall, which opened in 1968.\n\"The acoustics of the hall weren't great from 1968 to 2006. It was fine but it wasn't gorgeous. And it needs to be beautiful. I mean, it needs to be absolutely beautiful. And now it is.\"\nAfter the system was installed, it took about two years of tinkering with all the parameters within each setting to find the perfect sound, which Tarnopolsky says is fantastic whether it's a taiko drumming ensemble performing or the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra or a solo trumpet player.\nNow, it's just the sound of Zellerbach.\nBut the settings are still changed on special occasions. Recently, the First Congregational Church in Berkeley suffered a fire, and Cal Performances moved three musical performances to Zellerbach Hall -- Choir of Trinity Wall Street and Trinity Baroque Orchestra, Jordi Savall and Hesperion XXI, Nicola Benedetti and Venice Baroque Orchestra -- because of the hall's ability to create acoustics similar to the church.\nNow, there are more than a dozen installations of the acoustic system in the San Francisco Bay Area and some 100 across the world in spaces that range from concert halls to restaurants to conference rooms.\nBut you'll never know. Because when Constellation is working, it's invisible. It's creating an acoustic experience that just feels right.\nFor a schedule of upcoming performances in Zellerbach Hall, visit Cal Performances.\nThis article first appeared on Berkeley News on Dec. 23, 2016.\nGet the latest Berkeley news in your inbox with Berkeleyside's free Daily Briefing.

The songwriting duo of Molly with Charles took root and blossomed in a matter of weeks, accelerated by the impending matriculation of vocalist Molly Arizona. Over the course of several days last August, she and Charles Nutrivore honed a concise set of songs inspired by the sleek and emotionally simmering pop of Sade and Frank Ocean. Charles with Molly celebrates the release of the new EP q + m Friday at the Back Room, a concert conceived as a fundraiser for the Berkeley High jazz program.\nThe project owes its existence to the school's creatively charged atmosphere. Last May, Nutrivore (aka songwriter, pianist and producer Jackson Kinder) connected with Arizona (aka vocalist and then-Berkeley High senior Molly Sazer Hopf), and their first writing session produced the lithe synth pop song \"Thank You for Existing.\" The piece had so much promise they decided to focus on a songwriting collaboration. There was one complication. She was about to head east to start her studies at Boston University.\n\"As a producer I'm always looking for cool singers,\" says Nutrivore, who's making the most of a gap year before starting Pomona College. \"I'd gone to school with Molly at Berkeley High and after that first fruitful collaboration I realized we're very much on the same page musically. We had two weeks before she went off to BU, so we holed up in my garage for a crazy whirlwind of music making.\"\nFriday's concert features largely the same cast of players who contributed to q + m, with bassist Max Schwartz, vocalist Dante Ryan, guitarist David Marcus, and rapper MBK ZU. Richmond rapper Nekhi Foster and East Bay vocalist Amen'Auset play an opening set.\n\nArizona and Nutrivore both hail from families deeply engaged in creative pursuits. His father was a longtime Pixar employee who directed the 2015 indie film White Rabbit. She was weaned on music by her parents, and has spent many summers teaching at the music camp led by her mother, violinist, vocalist and Real Vocal String Quartet bandleader Irene Sazer.\n\"I started writing songs in 4th or 5th grade with my best friend,\" Arizona says. \"Around 6th grade I started writing by myself, and it's been that way until I ended up in this collaboration with Jackson. We'd been friends and talked about doing music together, but it really came together when he said 'Hey I wrote this song, you should come and sing on it.'\"\nNutrivore credits his experience in the Berkeley High jazz program with providing a sense of community and offering a window into the wider world. He took part in the band's trip to Cuba last January, which drove home \"how music is a universal language,\" he says. \"It's a cliche, but I hadn't fully processed it until I went there, being able to connect with these young Cuban over a montuno\" [a highly syncopated piano ostinato].\nThe experience crystalized his commitment to unleashing music's power to bring down social barriers, at home and abroad. In making q + m, he recruited a disparate cast of players from around the region, like South Berkeley rapper Dante Ryan.\n\"It's a very progressive city but there are entrenched divisions, equally bad as the rest of the country,\" Nutrivore says. \"Music is a way to start to overcome those divisions. Dante is from Berkeley, but we'd probably never have been friends if not for music. There are so many connections I wouldn't otherwise have made. I've tried to use that as a guiding philosophy, seeking out and bringing disparate sounds and people together.\"\nFollow Berkeleyside on Twitter and on Facebook where we often break news.

Photo: Berkeley LawThe University of California announced late on Friday afternoon settlement in the March 2016 lawsuit filed by Tyann Sorrell, alleging sexual harassment by then-UC Berkeley law school dean Sujit Choudhry. Sorrell sought damages against the university and Choudhry. At the same time, the university settled the legal disputes it had with Choudhry, arising from the lawsuit and subsequent events.\nSorrell had alleged she was subject to \"near daily\" harassment, including hugging and kissing from September 2014 until March 2015, when Sorrell used her own sick and vacation time to go on leave (read her full suit). Her suit was filed following the conclusion of an internal investigation by the Office for Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD). The OPHD findings that Choudhry had violated the university's policies were sent to then-Executive Vice Chancellor Claude Steele, who docked Choudhry's salary by 10% for one year and required a letter of apology to Sorrell. Steele resigned his administrative post to return to teaching in the psychology department in April 2016.\nUniversity of California President Janet Napolitano, faced with a growing storm about sexual harassment at UC Berkeley and other UC campuses, asked UC Berkeley administrators to start a second internal disciplinary procedure against Choudhry, through the Committee on Privilege and Tenure. Choudhry in turn filed a grievance against the Committee on Privilege and Tenure in April 2016, followed by a charge with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in August 2016, followed by a suit against the UC Regents, Napolitano, UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks, and others in September 2016. Choudhry dismissed that suit in November 2016.\nFriday's settlement resolved all the various claims, and all the legal actions and disciplinary procedures have been withdrawn.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Choudhry will pay $50,000 to charities of Sorrell's choice and $50,000 to Sorrell's lawyers. Choudhry, who resigned as dean in March 2016 when Sorrell filed her suit, will voluntarily resign from the faculty on May 31, 2018. He will continue to use an office in University Hall until the end of the current academic year, and not be present at the law school. He will then go on unpaid sabbatical for one year, until his resignation from the faculty. He will not be present at the law school during the sabbatical.\nChoudhry is still listed on the Berkeley Law website as the I. Michael Heyman Professor of Law.\nAs part of the settlement, Sorrell agreed to a statement where she recognized and appreciated the steps that the university has recently taken to increase its training and prevention activities regarding sexual harassment. Moreover, she said she is pleased that the university is reexamining all of its policies regarding sexual harassment, whether the harassment involves students, faculty, staff or administrators. Sorrell said she hopes that this progress will continue and that the voices of those who have experienced sexual harassment will be part of the dialogue for change.\nBut Sorrell was not party to the university's agreement with Choudhry. On Friday, through her lawyers, Levy Vinick Burrell Hyams, Sorrell criticized the agreement.\n\"This deal insults all who suffer harassment at the hands of those with power and privilege,\" she said.\nLeslie F. Levy, the lawyer who represented Sorrell in the lawsuit, said, \"A year ago UC President Janet Napolitano called for disciplinary process that could have led to Choudhry's loss of tenure. Now they've done an about-face and are letting him off with no discipline and a clean record. This is just one more example of UC refusing to take sexual harassment seriously and once again offering a soft landing even after a finding of harassment.\"\nLevy went on to say, \"It is no accident that UC opted to make this public late on a Friday evening, attempting to avoid the scrutiny of the public and the reaction of the students to their continued mishandling of these matters.\"\nShe further reiterated that, despite any implications to the contrary, \"This deal was made between the University and Choudhry. Ms. Sorrell finds the package of benefits provided to Choudhry in this settlement to be outrageous.\"\nThe Choudhry case arose less than five months after Geoff Marcy, a member of UC Berkeley's astronomy department, left the university following a campus investigation that found him guilty of sexually harassing students. More recently, architecture professor Nezar AlSayyad was suspended from teaching for one semester after an OPHD investigation. And last month, famed philosopher John Searle and the UC Regents were sued by Joanna Ong, who alleged she was fired from her job as a research assistant for rejecting Searle's advances.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Former law dean, UC Berkeley settle sexual harassment suit", "Tags": "['Sexual harassment']", "Sections": "['Schools', 'Schools', 'UC Berkeley']", "Natural Language Location": "UC Berkeley", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.869861", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "254742", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.258765", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/04/17/former-law-dean-uc-berkeley-settle-sexual-harassment-suit/", "Author": "Lance Knobel", "Date": "2017-04-17T13:15:00-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Realm Charter Middle School. Photo: Nancy RubinREALM Charter School is no longer out of a home for the 2017-18 school year, after obtaining a lease from the Berkeley Unified School District for a set of classrooms in a West Campus building.\nREALM's high school currently rents a much larger space at the site but will have to move at the end of the school year to make way for planned renovations and BUSD programs. The new lease, approved unanimously by the Berkeley School Board April 12, allows REALM to remain in the eight available classrooms at the site at 1222 University Ave.\nREALM's high school and middle school are now set to swap spots next year. The high school will move to 2023 Eighth St. and the middle school will relocate to the West Campus rooms.\nAfter struggling to find a new permanent home, REALM had requested an extension of its current lease earlier this year. In January, the Berkeley School Board denied that request. The district plans to use West Campus as a temporary site for BUSD students displaced by construction at other schools. Eventually, it could become a brand new elementary school.\n\nIn March, REALM came back to the board and proposed the consolidated REALM lease approved April 12.\nREALM will rent the space at $3 per square foot plus custodial and maintenance costs. Under the conditions of the new lease, REALM cannot request to extend its stay at the West Campus after the 2017-18 school year. BUSD is not required by the state to provide a facility to REALM because neither of its schools serves the minimum of 80 students from within the district.\nThe Berkeley School Board in March 2017. Photo: Natalie OrensteinVictor Diaz, REALM's executive director, said he is relieved to have secured a site for the year.\n\"Overall I'm thankful, and it will be a great space for the middle school,\" he said. \"I think we could have reached this agreement earlier in the year and probably had less trepidation on everyone's part. But there were a lot of moving pieces.\"\nAnd for a while during Wednesday's meeting, it was not clear anything would even be settled by the end of the night. Although REALM had proposed moving the middle school to the West Campus, the representatives from the charter school said recent discussions with families led them to believe it might be wiser to keep the high school there. They pointed out that sixth-grade students would end up spending each year of middle school at a different site if they stuck with the terms of the lease.\nSome School Board members said they would support giving REALM the flexibility to decide which school went where after the lease was approved.\n\"I want to be more like the landlord,\" leasing out the space but allowing the tenants to use it as they wish, said director Karen Hemphill.\nOthers said they didn't want any ambiguity in the agreement.\n\"We're here to make a decision, and given the past communication challenges we've had I'd be very uncomfortable with changes in any way,\" Daniels said.\nIf REALM decided to have the high school at West Campus, a different lease would have to be drawn up and considered at the next meeting, he said.\nAfter taking a break to confer outside, the REALM representatives said they would stick with the proposed lease for the middle school.\nREALM families and staff packed into the March 8 Berkeley School Board meeting to defend their schools. Photo: Natalie OrensteinThe new facility does not guarantee a certain future for the charter school, however.\nThe discussion of REALM's facility needs has been wrapped up in concerns about the school's financial stability. In January the School Board cited REALM for fiscal mismanagement, following an audit that found the middle school ended the 2015-16 school year with a negative fund balance of more than $1.1 million. The high school ended with a positive balance of $243,646.\nIf REALM does not present the board with a satisfactory plan to fix its financial problems by July 1, the board will consider revoking its charter.\nDiaz said the settled facility issue will allow REALM to focus on cleaning up its finances and finding a permanent site for the future.\nHe already took the unprecedented action of laying off teachers in the middle of the school year this spring.\n\"It's unfortunate, but right away it allows us to right-size our expenses,\" Diaz said. \"It's a huge first step.\"\nThanks in part to secured and potential grant funding, REALM is projecting a positive ending balance for both schools next year, he said.\nBut the uncertainty about the facilities and publicity around the financial woes caused many current and prospective students to reconsider enrolling in the schools next year, he said.\nMany of those families are fiercely supportive of REALM and turned out in droves to a March board meeting to advocate for the schools. The parents and students said REALM is a safe haven for kids from districts with safety issues and weaker academic programs. The schools serve a far higher percentage of students of color and low-income students than BUSD.\nREALM, which opened in 2011, is Berkeley's only charter school.

Board of Education. In 1946 9-year-old Mendez, the child of Mexican and Puerto Rican immigrants, was denied enrollment in an Orange County public school because she was not white. Her father Gonzalo Mendez ultimately took four school districts to court, winning a class-action lawsuit that ended legal segregation in the state. Seventy years after the landmark Mendez v. Westminster, 80-year-old Mendez is still a vocal education equality advocate who often speaks with young people about the relevance of her story today.\nMendez's visit to Berkeley began with a stop at Jefferson Elementary School on Thursday morning, where she surprised a classroom of second-grade students who made a short film about the activist this school year.\n\nThe students had been \"shocked to learn that there had been separate schools for students based on their ethnic background and/or color of their skin,\" wrote their teacher Lisa Rossi in a statement. The kids, who are the same age Mendez was when she was barred from attending a whites-only school, took a field trip to the San Francisco court that heard the Mendez v. Westminster appeal.\n\nChanneling their outrage into creative energy, the second-grade students wrote and acted in the short movie about the Mendez family, which won an award at the Bay Area International Children's Film Festival in March.\nSylvia Mendez visit Jefferson Elementary on April 13.

On the agenda: REALM Charter School's request to continue leasing district facilities; an update on restorative justice programs in BUSD; a policy protecting students and employees from any future religious registries; and more. Read the full agenda.\nHere are some of the highlights.\nREALM LEASE AT WEST CAMPUS The board will consider REALM Charter School's request to continue leasing some classroom space at the West Campus for the 2017-18 school year. Previously the board decided not to extend REALM High School's current lease of the facility, citing planned district uses of the West Campus next year, but REALM proposed consolidating its operations into the rooms that will remain vacant. Tonight the board will consider granting the lease under the condition that REALM not ask to extend it the following year. Even if the lease is approved, the charter schools' future remains uncertain. If REALM does not come up with a remedy for its significant structural deficit by July, the board may consider revoking its charter. See item 13.1 for details.\nDEVELOPER FEES Later this spring BUSD will begin collecting fees from developers of new residential and commercial property in Berkeley, per a unanimous School Board vote in February. The idea behind the practice: new development in the city could increase enrollment at its schools, requiring the costly construction of new district facilities. Tonight the board will decide whether to exempt development where at least half of the units house low-income residents. The fees are the maximum allowed by the state at $3.48 per square foot for residential development and 56 cents per square foot for commercial. Only future projects that do not yet have building permits will be affected. BUSD has never levied developer fees before. See item 13.2 for details.\n\nRESTORATIVE JUSTICE UPDATE The board will hear an update on the district's restorative justice practices and other behavior intervention programs. These initiatives run the gamut from counseling to peer mediation programs. The staff presentation will also focus on the expansion of restorative justice, the \"core of a District-wide effort to continue to shift from punitive, exclusionary school discipline to restorative means of correction, and to improve school climate in general,\" says the agenda item. See item 12.2 for details.\nRELIGIOUS REGISTRY POLICY A policy designed to keep students and staff out of government religious registries will get its first reading tonight. The policy, a reaction to Trump administration talk of a Muslim registry, would prohibit the district from tracking students' or employees' religious identities. District staff would also be banned from assisting in the creation of, or enforcing, a government religious or ethnic registry. See item 14.2 for details.\nLCAP UPDATE Next year's Local Control Accountability Plan -- which describes the district's goals and plans for allocating state funds -- will be finalized in June. Before that, the board will pre-approve the elements that affect teacher placement next year. Tonight the board will receive an update on staff LCAP recommendations before making those decisions later this month. See item 14.1 for details.\nMeeting details\nThe Berkeley Unified School District Board of Education generally meets twice monthly on Wednesdays at 2020 Bonar St. The entrance to the board chambers is around the corner on Addison Street. There is a large parking lot around the corner from Addison Street, on Browning Street.\nThe regular meeting is set to begin by 7:30 p.m. Public comment is limited to 30 minutes, with a 3-minute limit per speaker. Public comment takes place at the beginning and end of the meeting, rather than in response to each item.\nMeetings are televised live on Berkeley Community Media channel 33, and rebroadcast the following Thursday at 9 a.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. Meetings are also recorded for radio and played after the meeting on KPFB 89.3 FM.

Photo: Natalie OrensteinAt a March Berkeley School Board meeting, some Washington Elementary School families engaged in a bit of performance art to drive a point home.\nA father of a Washington student stood next to two others and addressed the board.\n\"This is what the California Department of Education says is the appropriate number of students per acre,\" he said.\nHe brought up a few more people, then several more -- until a crowd was huddled around the podium.\n\n\"This is Washington today,\" he said, meaning the density of students at Washington is four times what the state considers appropriate.\nThe demonstration was part of the latest resurgence of advocacy around capacity issues that have dogged the district since it began weathering a significant increase in elementary school enrollment several years ago.\nA few years back, a parent used Google Maps and student enrollment data to determine the density of Berkeley's elementary schools. While that study -- reenacted by parents at the March 22 meeting -- has not been endorsed by the district, everyone agrees that space is tight. Washington is one of the schools that has grown the most, but throughout the district much of the increase has been concentrated in South Berkeley, including at two new portables at LeConte this school year.\nAdministrators have spent a lot of time looking at possibilities for increasing both physical capacity and staffing across the district. The school board has identified some \"flex\" classroom space, added portables to campuses and made some changes in the way staff is distributed -- but there is no easy fix to remaining shortages, the district says. Parents say something has got to give.\nAt the March 22 School Board meeting parents crowded around the podium to demonstrate over-crowding. Photo: still from meeting videoWashington has seen a one-third increase in the student body in fewer than 10 years. Between 2010 and 2012, the enrollment spiked from 370 students to 425.  The school currently serves 458 students. The district says enrollment is projected to subside slightly next year.\nPortables across McKinley Street from Washington's campus have allowed the school to accommodate extra students. Initially, very old portables used for enrichment there were converted into homeroom classes. Then in 2013-14, they were replaced with newer portables from Berkeley High School.\nAt the time there was vocal opposition from parents, who said it was a safety hazard to have young kids crossing the street to get to the main campus, using bathrooms with an outdoor entrance, or being stuck in the portables without the option to lock down during a crisis.\nThe district hired a crossing guard and added the ability for the portables to communicate with the front office and lock down when necessary, assuaging many of the concerns.\nStill, \"it's tight,\" said Keira Armstrong, parent of a student in the fifth grade and a member of the PTA at Washington. \"There's not enough room for musical instruments or backpacks inside.\"\nThe squeeze is also evident on the crowded playgrounds, she said. The lunch period has been truncated -- at one point only 15 minutes long -- to fit in multiple shifts of kids.\n\"What we're also noticing is just the inability to serve the number of kids we have with staffing positions that are not staffed proportionately,\" Armstrong said.\nThe parents at Washington say the increase in enrollment at their school and at others in the BUSD puts the greatest pressure on special education and academic support staff. While the number of classroom teachers corresponds to the number of students, each elementary school is designated two full-time special education teachers and one literacy coach - regardless of size. So when school populations grow, the parents say, the kids who need the most support suffer a greater loss.\n\nIn the district's Local Control Accountability Plan, funding for some academic support staff, like English language teachers, is proportionate to the number of high-needs students at each K-8 school, but that works out to a minimal difference in staffing from site to site. At Malcolm X, the largest elementary school, the district has also funded an additional part-time special education teacher. BUSD is not funding extra teachers at Washington, but the school site council discretionary funds and PTA fundraising have supported some extra staffing.\n\"It's not the intended purpose of the PTA to raise money for an academic necessity,\" said Mimi Pulich, a member of the BUSD LCAP committee and a former Washington parent who has been active in protesting overcrowding.\nThe district is researching how staff can be better distributed but says hiring additional special education teachers would come at a cost.\n\"We would love to find a way to address proportionality. That's something we've wrestled with,\" said Assistant Superintendent Pasquale Scuderi. \"We appreciate and recognize the need but it's not like we can make that decision in isolation.\"\nAt the same board meeting where parents crowded around the podium to demonstrate density, staff presented an initial list of budget priorities for 2017-18. Matching up RTI staffing to each school's needs is on the list, though no amount of funding to do so has been determined. (RTI is short for Response to Intervention, an approach used at BUSD and many other districts to teach students with academic and behavioral challenges.)\nBut BUSD is facing a structural deficit of $500,000  and board members said serious cuts are in order.\nIncreasing and proportionally distributing staff so each school's needs are fully met would require \"a notable amount of additional resources,\" Scuderi said.\nHe said spreading thin resources around on a proportional basis can backfire. Adding a teacher who works a small fraction of full-time at an elementary school may not accomplish much besides frustrating the staff member.\nWhile enrollment at Washington is expected to decrease a bit next year, the district has also projected an increase of 144 students across BUSD in the next five years. Meanwhile, the elementary school bubble will not burst until those students graduate high school. In order to accommodate the incoming growth at the middle school level, the district plans to move Willard's performing arts program to the West Campus, where the School Board meets.\nThe upcoming renovation of that site, using revenue from the 2010 Measure I, will position it to potentially serve as a new 15-classroom elementary school in the future.\nParents say they want a shorter-term fix. If a new school is not opened in the next five years, an \"entire generation\" of kids will be at crowded campuses throughout their elementary school tenures, Armstrong said.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Washington Elementary parents sound alarm about overcrowding", "Tags": "['Berkeley School Board', 'Berkeley Unified School District', 'School overcrowding', 'Washington Elementary School']", "Sections": "['Schools', 'Schools']", "Natural Language Location": "Washington Elementary", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.86668", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "253223", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.273085", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/04/03/berkeleys-washington-elementary-parents-sound-alarm-overcrowding/", "Author": "Natalie Orenstein", "Date": "2017-04-03T09:00:05-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "The Bonar Street headquarters of the Berkeley Unified School District. Photo: Kaia DiringerInformation on student achievement and disparities at Berkeley schools is available in a new interactive -- and quite colorful -- database.\nWith the California School Dashboard the state has abandoned an accountability system based exclusively on standardized test scores. The \"dashboard\" includes other measures, like suspension rates and English learner progress, meant to paint a more comprehensive portrait of student achievement and reveal areas needing improvement. Performance in each category is ranked on a color-coded scale based on current status and yearly progress. The rankings are broken down by student demographic group at both the school and district levels, with the intention of identifying groups falling behind.\nDistricts will also have to report their progress on new indicators including school climate and parent engagement. Detailed information on how data is collected for each indicator is available on the state Department of Education website.\nPhoto: Screen shot from the California School DashboardThe pilot version of the school dashboard went live earlier this month and will be fleshed out with more information this fall and in subsequent years.\n\n\"Our hope is that can we learn from this data in terms of setting goals for our students or schools next year,\" said BUSD Superintendent Donald Evans.\nSo far, the dashboard entries for BUSD and its schools are populated with data that was previously collected, some two or three years old, but the new website makes it easy to compare and contrast. What is available on the site so far highlights disparities between schools and between the different student groups within each school.\nOxford Elementary School, for example, gets blue (the best performance ranking) across the board for lowest suspension rates, based on 2014-15 numbers and progress. Across town at LeConte, however, the suspension rates for many student groups -- including socio-economically disadvantaged students, those with disabilities and African Americans -- are much higher, dipping into the orange and red ratings at the bottom of the color scale.\nAt the high-school level, white and Hispanic students are also suspended less frequently than African-American students. The Berkeley High School 2015 graduation rate for English learners is far lower -- 68%, which contributes to an ultra-low red rating -- than any other group tracked.\nThe dashboard still includes standardized test scores. All California students take the Smart Balanced Assessment (SBA) tests for English language arts and math in grades three through eight and 11th grade. The state is trying out a science test this spring as well.\nThe current academic rankings on the dashboard are based on 2016 SBA scores. The variation, both among Berkeley schools and among student groups, is striking. At the middle school level, for example, King gets the highest, blue, rank for math scores overall, though certain student groups have lower ratings. At Longfellow the gap is even wider, with white students scoring blue and African-American and Hispanic students getting the second-to-lowest orange rank. Willard gets an overall orange rank for math test scores, with several groups earning the lowest red score.\nPhoto: Screen shot from the California School Dashboard\"The SBA is just one way of measuring student outcomes,\" Evans said. \"That's just a snapshot, and we have other snapshots.\"\nBut the dashboard is far more elaborate than the old method of tracking student and school performance. Schools used to receive a single Academic Performance Index score based only on standardized tests. The API was a number on a scale of 200 to 1,000, with 800 being the goal. Berkeley High's most recent API score was 735.\nTo the chagrin of some educators and administrators who bemoaned its simplicity, some parents used the API score to decide where to enroll their children or buy a home.\nThe dashboard is \"a more complex instrument, showing both status and progress on indicators, making it difficult to compare schools and districts at a glance, but overall this should yield a more meaningful portrait of a school or district than a single score,\" said BUSD spokesman Charles Burress in an email.\nSee the district's webpage on the dashboard.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "New state report card goes beyond test scores for Berkeley schools", "Tags": "['Berkeley Unified School District', 'Donald Evans']", "Sections": "['Schools', 'Schools']", "Natural Language Location": "2020 Bonar St", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.869529", "Zip Code": "94702", "ID": "252335", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.287563", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/23/new-state-report-card-goes-beyond-test-scores-berkeley-schools/", "Author": "Natalie Orenstein", "Date": "2017-03-23T12:30:29-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "The Berkeley School Board in 2015.

On the agenda: physics for freshmen; Common Core math implementation; a possible bond measure for building teacher housing; a look at \"confusing\" complaint policies; and more. Read the full agenda.\nHere are some of the highlights.\nSCIENCE AND MATH CLASS SEQUENCES The Berkeley High School science class sequence could get flipped around in the effort to align the curriculum with the Next Generation Science Standards, new science education guidelines adopted by many states. The proposed sequence has all freshmen taking physics, whereas the small minority of BHS students who currently take the course do so as juniors or seniors. The board might vote on the new course progression Wednesday, paving the way for some freshman physics classes in 2017-18 and full implementation in 2018-19. It could be part of a complete overhaul of the ninth-grade program that year. See item 12.1 for details.\nThe BHS math program is also being reconfigured, and the board will hear a progress report Wednesday. The new three-year math class sequence is meant to meet Common Core standards, integrating traditional math subjects with a focus on conceptual thinking. The third and final year of the program will be implemented in 2017-18. So far the district has allocated $200,000 for teacher collaboration and preparation time each year as the new math program is developed, but there will be less funding in the budget for Common Core implementation next year. See item 12.2 for details. New math support classes for the middle schools and high school are included in Local Control and Accountability Plan recommendations on the agenda Wednesday as well. See item 14.3 for details.\n\nTHE 2017-18 BUDGET The board will look at new budget considerations for the 2017-18 school year. According to a district report, reductions will be necessary. BUSD is looking at a $.5 million structural deficit, due in part to a decline in student enrollment and to increasing personnel costs, according to the district. State reimbursements for mandatory costs have also decreased significantly. Among the most expensive new needs identified in the report are the $550,000 annual BHS ninth-grade redesign cost, funding for two new school buses and $1.1 for Common Core implementation and training -- down from a bigger Common Core budget this year and likely to be cut in the coming years. See item 12.3 for details.\nTEACHER HOUSING BOND It is not easy to pay Bay Area rent on a teacher's salary, so some districts desperate to retain their staffs are figuring out how to provide housing themselves. On Wednesday the School Board will discuss the possibility of putting a bond measure on the 2018 ballot to build teacher housing in Berkeley. If BUSD chooses to pursue the bond, feasibility issues, possible locations and teacher demand will have to be considered. See item 12.4 for details.\nCOMPLAINT POLICIES The processes for filing or appealing a complaint with BUSD could use some streamlining, according to district staff. \"The District recognizes that there are overlaps and inconsistencies regarding the complaint policies and procedures that are confusing,\" says the item in the agenda packet. The information item will cover the different policies for different types of complaints, such as discrimination or bullying complaints. The district's new Title IX coordinator, Dana Clark, has been charged with revising the current system. At the last three board meetings, testimonies during public comment have criticized the way the district has handled sexual harassment complaints. See item 14.5 for details.\nMeeting details\nThe Berkeley Unified School District Board of Education generally meets twice monthly on Wednesdays at 2020 Bonar St. The entrance to the board chambers is around the corner on Addison Street.

Photo: Natalie OrensteinMany UC Berkeley students have sky-high ambitions, but this weekend some are going to new heights.\nMembers of the East Bay Amateur Radio Club and UC Berkeley's radio club are teaming up to launch a high-altitude balloon to near-space, and they are inviting the public to come track its journey. On Saturday, March 18 the group will launch the helium-filled latex weather balloon from Memorial Glade on Cal's campus at 10 a.m. and then, using software that tracks the balloon's location, chase after it in their cars.\nThe balloon is expected to reach an altitude of 90,000-100,000 feet.\n\"People tend to get finicky about what the absolute definition of the edge of space is, but that's the edge of space,\" said the East Bay club's Martin Rothfield, a retired communications professional.\n\nThe balloon will be outfitted with GoPro cameras and a radio. A UC Berkeley microbiologist will also load it up with scientific gear, to collect air samples from the flight.\nParticipants must ready for a bit of a road trip, as the balloon is expected to land somewhere near Stockton. The direction and strength of the wind could cause it to change its course. There is a one-in-five chance the wind will blow westward, meaning the balloon could land in the ocean, Rothfield said.\n\"The chase part is fun,\" he said. \"You're dependent on the radio onboard the capsule to track it. That's the only way to know where it is.\"\nThe radio sends signals to a network of ham radios connected to the internet. The location information is available in real-time to anybody with internet access.\nA high-altitude balloon. Photo: Wikimedia CommonsBut ham radio hobbyists were around long before the digital age. UC Berkeley's amateur radio club, W6BB, is more than 100 years old. The Richmond-based East Bay club, the sponsor of Saturday's launch, was started more than 50 years ago. Ham radios are often used for long-distance and emergency communication, and the local club members volunteer as safety officers stationed throughout Bay Area bicycle and foot race courses where cell phone service is unreliable. The Cal club and the East Bay club joined forces for a balloon launch two years ago as well.\nHigh-altitude balloon flights date back decades too, but modern technology offers new potential. The balloons can be used to conduct scientific experiments and cheaply test how well equipment will fare in space. One company is already selling tickets for crewed balloon flights to near-space -- but at $75,000 a ticket, so-called \"space tourism\" is not likely to fit into most summer vacation budgets.\nThe local amateur radio enthusiasts are a bit more down to earth. Saturday's launch will cost a few hundred dollars.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Amateur radio groups to send a balloon to the stratosphere and back", "Tags": "['UC Berkeley']", "Sections": "['UC Berkeley', 'UC Berkeley']", "Natural Language Location": "UC Berkeley", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.869861", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "251317", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.258765", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/16/amateur-radio-groups-send-balloon-stratosphere-back/", "Author": "Natalie Orenstein", "Date": "2017-03-16T11:00:36-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "The Realm Charter Schools are facing financial and space challenges. Photo: Nancy RubinBerkeley's only charter school is suffering financial woes and space constraints that pose serious challenges to its continuing viability.\nA recent independent audit of Revolutionary Education and Learning Movement (REALM) Charter Schools revealed the middle school ended the 2015-16 school year with a negative fund balance of more than $1.1 million. The high school ended with a positive balance of $243,646.\nThe deficit and recurring cash flow challenges \"cause substantial doubt about the Schools' ability to continue as a going concern,\" according to the REALM auditor's report.\nThe budget gap prompted the Berkeley School Board to issue a notice of violation to REALM in January for fiscal mismanagement and a failure to meet the conditions of its charter renewal in 2015. REALM has until July 1 to come up with a plan to remedy the financial problems. If the board is not satisfied with the plan, or REALM does not follow the plan, revocation of the schools' charter is on the table.\n\nMeanwhile, REALM's high school is out of a home at the end of the current school year. The district's plans to repurpose the West Campus at 2020 Bonar Street as a \"swing site\" during construction at other schools will displace the high school, which currently leases space at the site from the district. The School Board denied REALM's request for an extension of the lease for the 2017-18 school year while the school continues to search for a permanent facility.\nREALM families and staff packed into the March 8 Berkeley School Board meeting. Photo: Natalie OrensteinWhen the board renewed REALM's five-year charter in December 2015, it did so on several conditions -- including that the middle school would climb out of its deficit by the end of the 2016-17 school year. Instead, the deficit has grown since then.\nREALM Executive Director Victor Diaz did not respond to Berkeleyside's request for comment, but he described some of the sources of his schools' financial troubles in a November 2016 letter to the School Board, and during the public comment period at the March 8 board meeting.\nIn the letter, Diaz said REALM's special-education costs have increased as it has enrolled a growing number of students with special needs and hired staff to serve them.\nAt the board meeting, Diaz said high operating costs contributed to REALM's financial struggles during its early years.\nThen, \"over the last two years, a contributing factor was not having a sufficient admissions and registration policy, and connecting that to staffing,\" he said. \"We'd staff folks based on projections and not on actual enrollment. That was one of our learnings over the past two years and something we're going to correct.\"\nAs for the facility issue, Oregon-based company Charter School Capital has agreed to finance the purchase of a building it would lease to the high school, according to a March 1 letter from Diaz to the school board. REALM has identified two facilities in Berkeley and one in El Cerrito that may be able to house the school, but none would be available until 2018-19, Diaz wrote.\nParent: \"This is the city that's too expensive for these families to live in\"\nOn March 8, dozens of REALM teachers, students, and families packed into the board meeting to advocate for their schools.\nREALM High School student Genesis Rodriguez kicked off an impassioned public comment period, telling the board that the school provides a refuge for her classmates. Many come from districts outside of Berkeley and do not otherwise have access to a safe, stimulating school environment, she said.\nREALM admits applicants from anywhere, by lottery. The schools serve more disadvantaged students and students of color than BUSD. In the 2015-16 school year, 78.4% of REALM High School's students received free or reduced-price lunches, were English learners, or were in the foster care system, according to the California Department of Education. By contrast, just 31% of Berkeley High School's students were in one of those categories that year.\nLast year, REALM High School's student body was 64% Latino and 22% black, compared to the 21% Latino and 19% black student body at BHS.\n\"Our school represents exactly what Berkeley is always bragging to the planet from the highest towers about,\" said Pablo Paredes, parent of two middle school students, at the School Board meeting. \"We talk sanctuary city, but what does that look like? This is the city that's too expensive for these families to live in.\"\nAt REALM's Studio H, students design and build solutions to community problems. Photo: Tracey TaylorParedes has been active in organizing other REALM parents to advocate for the school. The parents, along with REALM staff, helped draw up a proposal for a temporary facilities arrangement. The proposal, submitted by Diaz to the board in March, includes a couple ideas. One involves moving the high school to the middle school's current site at 2023 8th St., and squeezing the middle school into a smaller space at the West Campus.\nCalifornia school districts are required to provide facilities to charter schools -- but only if the schools enroll 80 students who live in the district. Neither of REALM's campuses does. Additionally, the amount of per-pupil funding REALM receives from the state for its high-needs students is based on the much smaller number of high-needs students in BUSD, putting more financial pressure on the charter schools, noted the board's vice president Josh Daniels.\nDaniels said the board has suggested that REALM pursue a charter with another district, such as West Contra Costa, where the schools would receive facilities and more state dollars.\nREALM has an independent charter, which means BUSD provides oversight but not funding. However, the district has occasionally provided REALM cash advances amounting to three months of their share of local property taxes, said Javetta Cleveland, BUSD deputy superintendent, on Monday. REALM also pays below market rate rent, about $3 a square foot, for its West Campus space.\nAt the meeting, the board members praised REALM's academics and program but said BUSD has exhausted its ability to support the schools.\n\"At some point, we have a fiscal responsibility to our district,\" said Director Judy Appel.\nWhen the board renewed REALM's charter in 2015, \"it was clear REALM was providing an education to students that was a model in many ways,\" said Director Karen Hemphill.\n\"I certainly struggled myself about how do you communicate to a community that a school that is obviously so well-regarded is in deep financial trouble,\" she said.\nCathy Campbell, president of the Berkeley Federation of Teachers, asked the board to do anything it can to keep REALM in operation. She proposed appointing someone from BUSD to serve on REALM's board and offer fiscal advice.\n\"There is a significant lack of governance right now at the REALM charter schools,\" she said.\nREALM students build a library for their school in 2014. Photo: Natalie OrensteinThere are only three other board members besides Diaz, according to REALM's website.\nDaniels said he was skeptical that further support from the district would help.\n\"When they asked for help facilities-wise we granted them a facility,\" he said. \"When they asked for financial advice we provided that and it doesn't seem like the REALM leadership is listening or taking that advice.\"\nCharter schools in the spotlight\nREALM's charter was approved in 2010 and the schools opened the following year. The program emphasizes college readiness, social justice, and project-based learning. The schools have received some national attention for Studio H, an elective program run by a nonprofit. Studio H students learn to identify community needs and design and build solutions -- so far including tiny homes, a pop-up park, and a crowd-funded library for their own school.\nPrior to opening REALM, Diaz was principal of Berkeley Technology Academy, where he introduced technology and social justice elements into the curriculum. Berkeleyside interviewed Diaz in 2010 right after REALM was given the green light.\nIf REALM ends up closing, it would join other local charter schools with similar fates. Two of Oakland's 30-plus charter schools recently shuttered shortly after opening. Berkeley used to be home to another charter school, CAL Prep, a partnership between UC Berkeley and Oakland-based Aspire Public Schools, but it moved to Richmond in 2015.\nCharter schools have faced heightened criticism in recent months in light of President Donald Trump's pick for education secretary. Betsy DeVos, a fierce charter school proponent, spearheaded their proliferation across Michigan, where they have not yielded desired outcomes. Opponents of charter schools say they evade regulation and take money, but not always vulnerable students, from public schools. Often they are run by for-profit corporations.\nREALM is \"kinda the polar opposite\" of the stereotypical charter school, Paredes said.\nThe schools serve a higher portion of high-needs students than the surrounding district, and the teachers are unionized. In 2015, the California Charter Schools Association estimated that around 30% of charter schools in the state have some form of collective bargaining agreement.\nMany REALM staff members showed up at the March 8 school board meeting to support their place of work.\n\"The school that I work at is extraordinary, it is growing, it is strong,\" said Chloe Erskine, a middle school social studies teacher. \"We serve everyone who needs to be served, let's put it that way.\" She asked the board to consider the REALM community's facility proposal.\nBoard Director Beatriz Leyva-Cutler said: \"I'm hopeful that between now and July some magic can happen that will be some support there for REALM staff to find a location.\"\nIf the board revokes REALM's charter, the schools can appeal the decision and remain in operation throughout that process.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Budget woes threaten REALM Charter Schools", "Tags": "['Berkeley School Board', 'Berkeley Unified School District', 'Josh Daniels', 'Judy Appel', 'Karen Hemphill', 'REALM Charter School', 'West Berkeley']", "Sections": "['Schools', 'Schools']", "Natural Language Location": "REALM charter school", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.880589", "Zip Code": "94709", "ID": "251214", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.268376", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/13/budget-woes-threaten-berkeleys-realm-charter-schools/", "Author": "Natalie Orenstein", "Date": "2017-03-13T15:30:50-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Carol Christ.

Christ, UC Berkeley's interim executive vice chancellor and provost and the former president of Smith College, as her choice to become the campus' next chancellor, the first woman to serve in the role.\n\nThe UC Board of Regents will vote on the nomination Thursday during a special session held concurrently with the regular board meeting at UC San Francisco's Mission Bay campus. If approved by the regents, Christ, 72, will become UC Berkeley's 11th chancellor, effective July 1. The current chancellor, Nicholas B. Dirks, announced in August that he would step down to return to teaching and research once a successor is in place.\n\"I am delighted that Carol Christ has agreed to lead Berkeley at this pivotal time in the campus's storied history,\" Napolitano said. \"From among the many highly qualified candidates for the position, Carol's exceptional leadership and strategic planning skills, her deep commitment to the university's core values, her many academic and professional accomplishments, as well as her deep knowledge of, and affection for, UC Berkeley stood out.\"\nRead more on Berkeleyside about the UC Berkeley chancellor \"I feel honored and privileged to lead the campus at this challenging time,\" Christ said. \"It is a small way to give back for everything the university has given me. My experience at Berkeley has been transformational; it formed my ideas of higher education, and it formed my ideals of higher education. I look forward to working with Berkeley's many communities in the months and years ahead in a way true to UC's motto, 'Fiat lux' -- 'Let there be light.'\"\nThe wide-ranging search for a new UC Berkeley chancellor directly involved the broad spectrum of campus and community stakeholders.\nUC Berkeley Vice Provost and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Distinguished Professor in Microelectronics Tsu-Jae King Liu, who led the search team's faculty subcommittee, praised Christ as \"a renowned scholar and seasoned administrative leader who has the respect and trust of the Berkeley faculty.\"\n\"She is readily accessible, profoundly thoughtful and open to new ideas, and transparently decisive,\" Liu said. \"Her deep knowledge and appreciation for our university's traditions of access, excellence, and shared governance, her championship of diversity and inclusion, her genuine concern for student welfare and outreach to alumni and the local community will serve as the bedrock of her leadership. I look forward to working under her historic chancellorship to lead UC Berkeley into a new era of preeminence in research, teaching and public service.\"\nChrist, a Victorian literature scholar, came to UC Berkeley as an assistant professor in 1970 -- at a time when only 3 percent of the faculty were women -- and became chair of the English department in 1985. Three years later she was appointed dean of humanities, and in 1989, she became provost and dean of the College of Letters and Science.\nIn 1994, Christ was named vice chancellor and provost, and later became executive vice chancellor, making her the highest ranking female administrator on campus. During her years at UC Berkeley she earned a reputation as a tireless champion of gender equality and diversity; her first administrative position was as an assistant to the chancellor on issues involving the status of women, and Title IX compliance coordinator.\nChrist returned to full-time teaching in 2000 before leaving UC Berkeley in 2002 to become the 10th president of Smith College, one of the nation's most distinguished liberal arts colleges, where she led a wide-ranging strategic planning process that positioned the college for continued academic excellence and financial stability. Christ retired from Smith in June of 2013, a hiatus from academia that did not last long.\nIn January of 2015 she returned to UC Berkeley as director of the campus's Center for Studies in Higher Education, and in May of the following year she agreed to take up her former role of executive vice chancellor and provost on an interim basis.\nAs executive vice chancellor, Christ serves as UC Berkeley's leading senior executive responsible for the campus's day-to-day operations and finances. As provost, she is the chief academic officer on campus, charged with the planning, development, implementation, assessment and enhancement of all academic programs, policies and supporting infrastructure. She is responsible for ensuring UC Berkeley's academic preeminence by overseeing faculty recruitment, retention, and renewal as well as through review of appointments, tenure and promotion for UC Berkeley's 1,500 full-time faculty.\nChrist also oversees the planning, quality and delivery of education provided to UC Berkeley's 27,000 undergraduate students and 10,000 graduate students. These duties are in partnership with the Academic Senate under UC's principles of shared governance.\nThroughout most of her administrative career, Christ has continued to teach and pursue her academic research. She has published two books: \"The Finer Optic: The Aesthetic of Particularity in Victorian Poetry\" and \"Victorian and Modern Poetics.\" She also edited a Norton Critical Edition of George Eliot's \"The Mill on the Floss\" and co-edited the \"Norton Anthology of English Literature and Victorian Literature\" and \"The Victorian Visual Imagination.\"\nShe graduated with high honors from Douglass College, the women's college at Rutgers University, and received her Ph.D. in English from Yale University.\nChrist is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.\nThis story originally appeared at UC Berkeley News and has been reprinted with permission.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Update: Carol Christ named UC Berkeley chancellor by unanimous Regents' vote", "Tags": "['UC Berkeley', 'UC Berkeley chancellor']", "Sections": "['UC Berkeley', 'UC Berkeley']", "Natural Language Location": "UC Berkeley", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.869861", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "251253", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.258765", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/13/carol-christ-named-uc-berkeley-chancellor-designate-pending-regent-approval/", "Author": "Guest contributor", "Date": "2017-03-13T12:16:56-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "On Feb. 15, the Berkeley School Board voted to continue developing a redesign of the ninth grade. Photo: Nancy RubinOne student's experience at Berkeley High School can differ markedly from another's. Between enrollment in small schools, career preparatory programs and advanced classes, some classmates do not cross paths until they walk the stage together at graduation.\nA proposed redesign of the ninth-grade schedule and classes would make freshman year \"universal,\" rather than the current division into small schools and programs from the outset. Under the plan, all students would take the same core academic classes, in small cohorts. Proponents say the shared experience could help decrease the achievement gap by setting all students off on equal footing and giving them the guidance they need to pick the right academic program for the next three years.\nA \"Design Team\" of BHS staff and students began discussing the overhaul in fall 2015. Earlier this year, the group scaled down the proposal, due to budget constraints, to focus solely on ninth grade. In February, the Berkeley School Board voted unanimously to continue pursuing the ninth-grade redesign, which is expected to cost $500,000-$600,000 per year.\nThe Design Team, co-led by Communications Arts and Sciences (CAS) teacher Hasmig Minassian and Berkeley International High School (BIHS) economics teacher Matt Meyer, will present a final proposal to the board in May, before a likely final vote in June. If the plan passes, BHS will spend the following year preparing for implementation in fall 2018.\n\nCurrently, incoming BHS freshmen enroll in an academic program -- the CAS, Academy of Medicine and Public Service (AMPS), or Arts and Humanities Academy (AHA) small schools, or the Academic Choice or BIHS programs -- by lottery. The proposed plan postpones that process. All freshmen would instead be divided into diverse \"houses\" of around 120 students and four teachers. The students would take math, science, English and history with others in their house. Students could take two additional classes outside of the program, and could test into an advanced math course outside of their house.\nMembers of the Design Team presented an early proposal to the board at a special meeting in February. Photo: Still from BUSD meeting videoEach ninth-grade teacher, who would only teach within his or her house, would be responsible for four class periods, and one course for high-needs students. Teachers would also have a preparation period to collaborate with other teachers across the grade.\nThe plan also modifies the ninth-grade bell schedule so classes last longer but meet less often.\nStaff members initially were inspired to pursue the redesign after learning about research from the School Redesign Network at Stanford University. The proposal incorporates strategies suggested by the researchers to improve instruction and teacher collaboration in intimate learning environments.\n\"The small schools model -- of a group of teachers rallying around a group of students -- is one all students should have access to during their time of transition from middle school to high school,\" Minassian said.\nOf the three current small schools, CAS is the oldest, founded in 1997. The district later embraced the small school movement, opening three more, including AHA and AMPS (then called the Community Partnerships Academy), in 2005. While some continue to herald small schools and the personalized attention students receive there as the solution to the achievement gap, others say they increase segregation and academic disparities. The Gates Foundation, an early major investor in small schools including Berkeley High's, backed away in 2009, saying student achievement had not improved in that context.\nInaccurate public perception, along with parental or peer pressure, too often sway incoming students when they select their small learning community or academic program in the eighth-grade lottery, Minassian said. During the universal ninth-grade program, students would attend presentations by all three options -- the small schools, AC and IB -- before participating in a lottery for 10th grade.\nThe new structure \"provides them with that bridge into a complex bureaucracy,\" Minassian said. Freshmen will also learn about career technical education offerings and hands-on training for jobs in various industries.\n\"There's a whole Berkeley High that kids don't even know about in eighth grade,\" Minassian said.\nThe redesign is the latest effort to decrease the racial achievement gap at Berkeley High. District data from the 2012-13 school year showed that, while academic achievement and attendance improved for all students, black students were still far less likely than their white peers to pass AP exams, and more likely to be chronically absent from school and suspended.\nIn 2016, former BHS Principal Sam Pasarow, when he was on the Design Team, said white students were four times likelier to take an advanced math class than black students, and seven times likelier to take AP science. That difference could be due in part to the disproportionately high population of students of color in small schools, which offer some of their own math and science classes.\nAt the Feb. 15 Berkeley School Board meeting, BHS science teacher Glenn Wolkenfeld praised the redesign, saying the equity issues will persist without a systemic overhaul.\n\"Well-meaning people have proposed program after program and the result has been the creation of a school that is fragmented and deeply self-contradictory,\" Wolkenfeld said. \"Segregation is everywhere you look.\"\nLast spring, a poll of Berkeley High teachers and staff found 84% supported a redesign, according to Vice Principal Tamara Friedman, a member of the Design Team.\nNot everyone, however, is on board. John Tobias, an AMPS history teacher, said he thinks the redesign could be a blow to his and other small schools.\n\"If we're seeing kids for the first time in 10th grade, when their GPAs start to matter for college, that undermines our ability to build community,\" he said.\nUnder the proposed redesign, no student would have any of their ninth-grade teachers again in a later grade. AMPS practices \"looping,\" a strategy also supported by the Stanford research, where teachers work with the same students for multiple years. Tobias said he has witnessed its benefits.\n\"I know [my students'] strengths and challenges, and I'm going to be there from day one,\" he said. \"They're calling this an effort at personalization, and I see some of that. But nobody is going to have the same teacher in ninth grade that they have in 10th, and that's a problem to me.\"\nSee the BUSD webpage on the redesign process.An initial redesign plan kept students in houses throughout high school, and created advisories in ninth and 10th grade. But that plan would have required the addition of a seventh period to the school day, which would have cost $1.3 million to $1.6 million. Ultimately the district could not come up with a way to pay for the new schedule, and decided to redesign ninth grade only.\nIn a February report responding to questions posed by the School Board, the Design Team said it is assessing funding options for the $500,000-$600,000 annual cost. The group said its goal is to allocate $200,000 from the district's general fund annually, which could require cuts in other areas. The group is also considering the use of $300,000 in Local Control Accountability Plan dollars and $150,000 from funds dedicated to BHS.\nAt the February meeting, board members praised the Design Team's process, which has included several presentations to staff, students and families. The board asked the group to come back in May with a final proposal including a budget, a description of how the new ninth-grade science class will meet the Next Generation Science Standards, details on the academic development course, and information about how small schools will be supported in becoming three-year programs.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Berkeley Unified moves forward with overhaul of ninth grade", "Tags": "['Achievement gap', 'Berkeley High School', 'Berkeley School Board', 'Berkeley Unified School District']", "Sections": "['Schools', 'Schools']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley High School", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.868063", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "250766", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.27179", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/09/berkeley-unified-moves-forward-with-ninth-grade-overhaul/", "Author": "Natalie Orenstein", "Date": "2017-03-09T09:00:47-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Jefferson Elementary School students demonstrate on International Women's Day, March 8, 2017.

See item 14.2 for details.\n\nInformation items\nMEASURE H Staff will update the district on Measure H expenditures and projected expenses. Measure H passed in 2010, continuing a parcel tax supporting BUSD maintenance projects. According to the district, Measure H is expected to generate nearly $6 million in fiscal year 2017. The district has spent $3.2 million of a projected $6.2 million. Measure H funds are used to hire maintenance staff, equipment, and vehicles, and to complete repairs on district buildings and landscapes. See items 15.1  and 15.2 for details.\nWEST CAMPUS Big changes are in the works for the West Campus at 2020 Bonar Street, where the School Board meets. Under a new district renovation plan, West Campus will serve as a \"swing site\" for classes displaced by construction at other schools, and will possibly be used as a new elementary school in the future. As the district works on equipping the site for its future uses, some programs will be immediately relocated to the West Campus, including Willard's arts program and career technical education programs. REALM Charter High School currently uses part of the building, but its lease expires in June and the school will need to relocate for the 2017-2018 school year. See item 15.3 for details.\nGENDER-NEUTRAL RESTROOMS Amid national discussion on transgender students' access to school restrooms, the Berkeley School Board will receive an update tonight on the status of gender-neutral bathrooms in its district. In 2015, BUSD created a single-stall gender-neutral restroom at each school. A survey of students in fall 2016, however, found that some of the new restrooms had incorrect signage or were not appropriately located. The district plans to assemble a working group to consider the creation of multi-stall all-student bathrooms. See item 15.4 for details.\nREALM AUDIT REALM comes up again: the board will receive a presentation of the findings from an independent audit of REALM Charter Schools. The findings reveal that REALM ended the 2015-2016 school year with an operating deficit of $1.1 million, which is less substantial than the previous year's deficit. BUSD issued REALM a notice of violation in January, citing fiscal mismanagement, the negative fund balance, deficit spending, and failure to maintain adequate cash flow. See item 15.5 for details.\nMeeting details\nThe Berkeley Unified School District Board of Education generally meets twice monthly on Wednesdays at 2020 Bonar St. The entrance to the board chambers is around the corner on Addison Street. There is a large parking lot around the corner from Addison Street, on Browning Street.\nThe regular meeting is set to begin by 7:30 p.m. Public comment is limited to 30 minutes, with a 3-minute limit per speaker. Public comment takes place at the beginning and end of the meeting, rather than in response to each item.\nMeetings are televised live on Berkeley Community Media channel 33, and rebroadcast the following Thursday at 9 a.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. Meetings are also recorded for radio and played after the meeting on KPFB 89.3 FM. They are also streamed live, and posted online after the meeting. Other BUSD-related videos are posted on Youtube.\nRead more Berkeleyside coverage related to Berkeley schools.

Photo: Tracey GoldbergBy Liat Levin, Berkeley High Jacket Sports Editor\nBerkeley High School's boys' soccer team captured its first North Coast Section championship in 13 years on Saturday night, defeating perennial powerhouse De La Salle in a thrilling shootout after a 1-1 deadlock through regular time and two overtimes.\nThe winning goal in the 4-3 shootout was scored by junior Paul Joseph, who had been promoted from the junior varsity for the NCS tournament. His winning strike was his first-ever touch for the varsity team. After Joseph's successful stab from the penalty spot, De La Salle's Logan Tingley had a chance to extend the shootout, but his tame kick into the middle of the goal was saved by Yellowjacket goalkeeper Roin Flynn. Teammates and Berkeley High fans stormed the field and mobbed Flynn after the save.\n\n\nTo quote Tiez Allison - \"...it just shows that you don't have to be an EBAL team to perform well in NCS. You can be Berkeley.\" [?][?] pic.twitter.com/WpFmjJOPMm\n-- BHS ATHLETICS (@BHSjacketSports) February 26, 2017\n\nThe Yellowjackets had reached the final after overtime wins in both the quarterfinals, against Foothill High School, and semifinals, against top-ranked San Ramon Valley.\n\nIn Saturday night's final against De La Salle, at neutral Dublin High School, Berkeley started strongly. The beginning of the match saw a lot of good possession and chances for the Jackets, which added to the wild energy of the strongly Berkeley crowd -- a constant force throughout the match.\nBerkeley's starting line-up featured six seniors, four juniors and one sophomore, a relatively experienced 11 for the biggest game of the season. The first half saw an even match in the midfield with great ball control by Senior Captain Arturo Verdin who out-jumped players much taller than him, and both teams had decent stretches of possession and a few chances. The 0-0 score at halftime reflected the even match.\nBHS Athletic Director Britta Fjelstrom spoke of Berkeley's strengths in the first half, noting, \"They really play as a team... I don't see people playing for their own glory. I feel that they are all playing for each other.\"\nThe second half began with a couple of good chances for Berkeley, but when junior Nick Lukan, whose long throw-ins had been a valuable asset to Berkeley throughout the season, went down with an injury with 35 minutes left in regulation, a goal was beginning to seem less likely. But the squad perked up when senior Tiez Allison subbed back in with 27 minutes left in regulation. Just five minutes later, a long drop kick by goalkeeper Flynn fell to Allison who speedily out-dribbled the De La Salle defense and sent a left-footed shot into the back of the net. The route one goal sent a roar through the fans and Berkeley's bench leaped up to celebrate what looked like a potential winning goal.\nNever count out De La Salle though, a team that won six straight NCS titles from 2008 to 2014. Even though Berkeley looked to have momentum immediately following its goal, De La Salle's sudden intensity, combined with some small lapses in focus for Berkeley, allowed a De La Salle goal with just six minutes left in the game. There were several good opportunities for both sides following the De La Salle goal, but neither team could put it away, so the game headed into overtime.\nNCS overtime is composed of two 10-minute \"golden goal\" periods, meaning that a goal scored at any point ends the game.\nBoth overtime periods were evenly matched, with some close shots for Berkeley and De La Salle. However, no winner was decided before the whistle signaled the end the second period of overtime, so Berkeley's fate would be decided by the always unpredictable penalty kicks.\nSenior captain Arlo Moore-Bloom took and made the first shot, followed by a save by Flynn. Senior Max Peterson and De La Salle's Wyatt Hattich both scored in the next round. The third round saw two misses -- a crossbar hit for Jacket junior Yohannes Kalonji and another save by Flynn. Senior Max Heintz made his shot along with De La Salle's Ian Nicolas. In the fifth round, Flynn took his shot but De La Salle goalie Jake Kirkpatrick saved it, and another goal for De La Salle followed. After five rounds, the score was 3-3. In the sixth round, junior Paul Joseph's goal followed by Flynn's save clinched the title for the Yellowjackets.\n\"It's been a long time since we've been here, so we are super proud of the boys for making it this far\"\nBHS principal Erin SchwengA sea of students, parents, and fans poured down from the stands and out onto the field to congratulate the newest Division I boys soccer champions of NCS.\nEver calm, cool and collected, goalkeeper Flynn said, \"I knew that I could trust my teammates to win... we practice penalties a lot in practice, I knew that they'd score theirs.\"\nFlynn, the hero of the shootout with three saves, said that the win \"felt like a long time coming.\" Peterson said, \"there's nothing better,\" and senior Darius Wekwerth said \"it's indescribable.\"\nWith 11 seniors leaving this year, the team faces a period of rebuilding, but the win cements Berkeley as a formidable opponent to look out for in the upcoming years.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Berkeley High boys soccer captures NCS title in penalty shootout drama", "Tags": "['Berkeley High School', 'BHS Yellowjackets']", "Sections": "['Schools', 'Schools']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley High School", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.868063", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "249561", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.27179", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/27/berkeley-high-boys-soccer-captures-ncs-title-penalty-shootout-drama/", "Author": "Guest contributor", "Date": "2017-02-27T11:29:50-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "A relay of Berkeley High students took turns reading Tori Burns' account of sexual harassment at the Berkeley School Board meeting on Wednesday Feb. 22. Photo: Still from meeting videoUpdate 9:50 p.m. The school district has provided a response to the public comments at Wednesday's school board meeting. Berkeleyside contacted BUSD seeking a response after the original story was published.\n\"Keeping our students safe is our highest priority, and we offer our full support and sympathy to any student who is a victim of sexual harassment and/or retaliation. We would never suggest to any student who fears for his or her safety that we are unable to provide for the student's safe access to education at Berkeley High, or that it would be best for the student to attend school elsewhere. We will work with students and their families to address all possible options and accommodations to ensure students feel safe, and are safe, at school. The Superintendent will follow up with the family in this case to ensure there is no misunderstanding about the District's commitment to the safety of our students. Beyond that, we cannot publicly discuss any individual student's case, even if students and their families choose to exercise their right to discuss their cases publicly.\"\nOriginal story, 2 p.m. For the second consecutive meeting, the Berkeley School Board on Wednesday night heard disturbing testimony from a high school student about sexual harassment. Two weeks ago, the board heard from Berkeley High junior Charlotte Wesley about a harassment experience that made her fearful of attending class and led her to enroll in Independent Study.\nWednesday, during public comment, a relay of Berkeley High students read out a statement from 14-year-old Tori Burns, who wrote that she has had to deal with persistent sexual harassment since last spring, when she was an eighth-grader at King Middle School. Burns, in her statement, said she came forward after reading Wesley's story on Berkeleyside.\n\nBurns had been assured by school officials that there was a safety plan in place to ensure that the boy who had harassed her at King would not be a threat to her at Berkeley High.\nRead more about sexual harassment cases within BUSD.\"On Sept. 1, I was going into first period walking with my sister and he deliberately tried to run into me,\" Burns wrote. \"My mom called and complained to [district compliance officer] Bev Bueno and [BHS dean of students] Mr. Rok and they pulled tape from that incident off the school camera.\n\"On the tape, you could see him seeing me and walking away from me at first, and then turning and moving fast and straight at me and only missing running into me because I moved out of the way. It was totally terrifying. Even Mr. Rok commented on it being really disturbing to watch. I was asked to fill out a form about what happened, and they knew it was wrong and scary and violated the safety plan.\n\"I filled out the form, but nothing changed.\"\nBurns' statement went on to detail continuing incidents without any action by the school. Three weeks ago, \"I stopped going to school altogether because I felt suicidal.\" (Watch video of the full School Board meeting.)\nBurns and her parents contacted Rebecca Levenson, an advisor to BHS Stop Harassing. Levenson went with Burns' parents to see Superintendent Donald Evans last week.\n\"He told them,\" Burns continued, \"the safest thing to do was for me to leave Berkeley High. BUSD chose the boy over me. They valued his right to an education more than mine... This will always be the story of my freshman year, the year you chose not to keep me safe, the year you chose him over me.\"\nIn powerful, tearful testimony, Burns' mother Cynthia said she'd seen other teenagers \"face the same hostile environment as my daughter.\"\n\"If this was your child, would you abandon her, too?\" she asked. \"Will you let the abuse continue and hide behind empty words? Shame on you.\"\nPeggy Scott, a member of the BUSD Sexual Harassment Advisory Committee, speaking before the reading of Burns' statement, said the school district had consistently failed to take necessary actions.\n\"The board prohibits retaliatory behavior or action against any person who reports files a complaint or testifies about or otherwise supports a complainant in alleging sexual harassment,\" Scott said. \"You must enforce this. They may not be empty words or you are not doing your job.\"\nWhen board members spoke after public comment, there was minimal reference to Burns' statement.\n\"I do want to let everyone know that I personally hear the stories,\" said Board Member Judy Appel. \"We're not stone walls up here. I hear you.\"\n\"I hear you. We hear you,\" echoed director Beatriz Leyva-Cutler. \"I know we can do better and I'm committed to that. It doesn't go unnoticed.\"\nBoard member and student director Petra Silvey read a joint statement from student leadership that called for \"effective restorative justice,\" and called on the district to \"take action to stop history repeating itself.\"\nBoard President Ty Alper, vice-president Josh Daniels and Superintendent Evans made no comment. The lack of specific response is mandated by the Brown Act. It prohibits direct, substantive responses to public comment because that would constitute a public discussion about a non-agendized item.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Berkeley High student recounts to School Board 'year you chose not to keep me safe'", "Tags": "['Beatriz Leyva-Cutler', 'Berkeley High School', 'Berkeley School Board', 'Berkeley Unified School District', 'BHS Stop Harassing', 'Donald Evans', 'Judy Appel']", "Sections": "['Schools', 'Schools']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley High School", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.868063", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "249318", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.27179", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/23/berkeley-high-student-recounts-to-school-board-year-you-chose-not-to-keep-me-safe/", "Author": "Lance Knobel", "Date": "2017-02-23T14:00:22-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "A photo gallery on a wall of the new Black Resource Center at UC Berkeley shows some of the protests that led to its opening. Photo: UC Berkeley/Ken LiBlack students and faculty at UC Berkeley celebrated the opening on campus Tuesday of the Fannie Lou Hamer Black Resource Center, a gathering and community space for the small minority of Black students at Cal. The idea for the center took root in the wake of the 2014 Ferguson protests and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, but several of the 200 or so who attended the opening made clear such a space had been lacking for decades, never mind, years.\nYvette Gullatt, head of diversity and engagement in the Office of the UC President, spoke at the opening of arriving at Cal as an undergraduate and feeling overwhelmed and isolated. With nowhere to go to find community with fellow Black students, she sequestered herself in the Moffitt Library all day and made few friends. Speaking of the efforts made by the students who campaigned to get the center open, Gullatt, who went on to get three degrees from Cal, said: \"I am so proud of you. You have shown that persistence works. I hope that this space will always be filled with people as it is filled now.\"\nAlan Banks points to one of the photographs on a wall of the newly opened Black Resource Center at UC Berkeley. Photo: UC Berkeley/Ken LiThe center, which is located in the Hearst Annex building, houses the African-American Student Development (AASD) office and will be a central resource for the Black community on and off campus, said Blake Simons, one of those who fought for the center.\n\"While the ... center is dedicated to the retention and academic/professional matriculation of Black identified students, anyone can use it,\" said Simons, who was hired as community development specialist at AASD shortly after he graduated Cal. Black students used to meet up in the former AASD office, then overseen by AASD director Mama Nzingha, but it was far from ideal. Blake describes it as being as big as the diminutive kitchen in the newly opened center. Simons said the decision was made to name the new space after Fannie Lou Hamer because \"often times we hear about Martin Luther King Jr., but not about Black women who contributed just as much, if not more to the Black freedom struggle.\" Hamer, who died in 1977, was a voting-rights activist, civil rights leader and philanthropist who was instrumental in organizing Mississippi's 1964 Freedom Summer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.\n\nAccording to UC Berkeley, just 3.2% (947) of undergraduates, and 3.7% (405) of graduate students at Cal are African-American. (These numbers only include US citizen and permanent resident African Americans -- international students who self-identify as Black are excluded.) And growth is slow -- in 2012, African Americans accounted for 3.7% of undergraduate enrollments across the whole UC system; in 2016 it was 3.9%\nUC Berkeley has had a dedicated Division of Equity and Inclusion since 2007 which currently has 150 full-time staff members. Gibor Basri, professor of astronomy (now emeritus), its first director, was replaced in 2015 by Na'ilah Nasir, a professor in the Department of African-American Studies.\nSpeaking at the center opening, Nasir stressed the ongoing importance of making and holding spaces for the Black community. \"We mustn't forget all we have gained and how far we've come,\" she said.\nNasir joined many of the actions that began in 2014 in which students protested what they described as a hostile environment for Black students on campus.\nHelped by two local activist groups -- the BlackOut Collective and the Afrikan Black Coalition -- students staged demonstrations and marches starting in December 2014 in the wake of the Michael Brown death in Ferguson, MI. On one of the protest days, the students gathered on campus with a view to marching through the city only to discover noose effigies hanging from Sather Gate and other spots. An anonymous artist collective later took responsibility for the action. Black Student Union members continued to campaign and negotiate with Cal Chancellor Nicholas Dirks until eventually, in August 2016, the university agreed to give the students a space and funds to convert it.\nA crowd gathers at the front door of the new Fannie Lou Hamer Black Resource Center at UC Berkeley waiting for the ribbon cutting at its grand opening on Feb. 21.

Previously a graduate student lounge, it was shabby, smelly and uninviting when the university made it available to the Black student body, according to Blake who oversaw its renovation. (The first offer of a basement room in the student union building was turned down.) With a budget of $83,000, the rooms are now freshly painted, including bold stripes in the colors the Pan-African flag, and there's new furniture and carpeting.\n\nBlake Simons: one of the many who fought for the new center. Photo: Courtesy Blake SimonsBlake said the new space will give them the ability to run programming and academic services, as well as the library/study space that meets the needs of the community.\nAs for what the new center means to him, Blake said that its opening makes all the challenges that he endured as a student at Cal worth it.\n\"I will forever have pride in my heart for what we accomplished as a community,\" he said. \"Being one of the founders of the Fannie Lou Hamer Black Resource Center is definitely one of the most rewarding experiences that I've had in my life -- as I know the sacrifices that I made were in honor of my ancestors. I am excited that students will have what I didn't, which is a dedicated center that serves Black students' socio-emotional needs, retention, professional development, and academic success.\"\nBlake and ab, a former Cal student who also works full-time at the AASD, hope that through the new center they will be also be able to forge meaningful partnerships in the Black community beyond UC Berkeley.\n\"In the future, we hope to work with B-Tech, Berkeley High, Oakland High schools, as well as Richmond schools,\" said Blake. \"We hope to establish a pipeline to local communities, so that at a young age students from these communities know that they belong at UC Berkeley.\"\nInside the Fannie Lou Hamer Black Resource Center at its grand opening on Feb. 21.

Photo: Natalie OrensteinDozens of members of Berkeley High School's BHS Stop Harassing club poured into the Berkeley school board meeting Wednesday night to demonstrate their frustration with the district's response to recent incidents of sexual harassment.\nEarlier in the evening, the board appointed a new Title IX coordinator and compliance officer, attorney Dana Clark, to oversee the investigation of all harassment claims.\nDuring the public comment period, BHS junior Charlotte Wesley and other students read a statement Wesley wrote about a harassment experience that made her fearful of attending class and led her to enroll in Independent Study.\nIn early December, Wesley told the board, a classmate showed her a group text message between him and his friends. The message thread included a text threatening to rape one of Wesley's friends, as well as links to nude photos and a sexual video of others.\n\nWesley, who stopped attending school for a month last year after being sexually assaulted, said she again felt \"unsafe and betrayed.\" She asked to see the friend's phone and took screenshots of the texts, which she sent to her friends and showed a BHS teacher and administrator.\n\"All the girls targeted experienced retaliation,\" Wesley said in her statement. \"We were stared down, yelled at, called 'stupid bitch,' and laughed at in the hallway and before and after school.\" Wesley said the boys involved in the text vandalized her car and threw eggs at her home, prompting her mother to consider selling the house. Wesley has stopped going to the classes where she would see the boys involved in the text.\n\nWesley said the district should do more to protect her and other victims of harassment and assault. She suggested a policy of collecting homework for victims who have to miss class. She also said the district should have told her its plan immediately.\n\"It's been 60 days--no restorative justice, no full safety plan, no academic accommodations, absolutely no closure,\" she said. \"Because I chose to stand up for what's right, I have paid the price socially, academically, and emotionally.\"\nBUSD issued a statement Friday calling it \"an extremely complicated and sensitive case involving two dozen students.\" The BHS administrative staff, as well as staff from the main office, have been actively investigating the case \"deliberately and carefully with the rights of all students considered,\" for the last two months, according to Charles Burress, a BUSD spokesman. However, since it does involve students, the district cannot comment on the particulars of the case, he said.\nBurress said the district is committed to shining light on issues of sexual harassment and using restorative justice, when possible, \"to repair the harm done to victims of sexual misconduct.\"\n\"We have long stressed that providing a safe learning environment for all students is the number one priority of our district and school staff,\" the statement reads. \"We have been working closely with student leaders and organizations, such as BHS Stop Harassing, in peer education and outreach. Teachers and staff have on-going training in our district policies and best practices for supporting students and reporting incidents. We continue to remind staff and families of the importance of talking to our students about harassment and bullying, and we are providing more information and training for students as well. In November, assemblies were held at BHS, organized by the BHS Stop Harassing student group and supported by BHS staff, in order to provide students with tools from Futures Without Violence, including these downloadable Teen Safety Card, as well as Who's Got Your Back?\"\nBHS Stop Harassing was formed in 2014 in response to other instances of harassment and cyber bullying. BHS students created the club to raise awareness among their peers of the prevalence of harassment on campus and to put pressure on the administration to respond to it.\nA few years earlier, a district Sexual Harassment Advisory Committee was created and charged in part with writing a new sexual harassment policy. The creation of a new policy was put on hold when, in 2015, the federal Office for Civil Rights began investigating whether BUSD had responded adequately to sexual harassment claims at BHS. Per OCR's recommendation, the board approved an interim updated policy in April 2015 created by the California School Boards Association.\nThe ongoing OCR investigation was prompted by a complaint letter from Heidi Goldstein, a member of the district's sexual harassment committee and a parent advisor to BHS Stop Harassing.\nAt Wednesday's board meeting, president Ty Alper told BHS Stop Harassing that the board hears its demands.\nThe Title XI coordinator position, he said, was created in part because of the \"fierce advocacy of many people in this room.\"\nClark brings significant experience to the district, said Burress. She has developed and implemented compliance and accountability systems, and \"has worked on social and environmental justice issues at the international, national, and local levels.\"\n\"It will be the job of the Title IX coordinator to coordinate the prompt, effective, and equitable investigation and timely resolution of all complaints alleging sexual misconduct, discrimination, bullying and other complaints filed with the district, and also to work with staff, students, and parents on effective, research-based strategies to prevent instances of harassment and bullying in the first place, which is of course our goal,\" said the BUSD statement.\nRelated:School Board adopts interim sexual harassment policy (04.10.15)Feds launch civil-rights investigation in Berkeley School District's response to sexual harassment claims (02.10.15)Students target sexual harassment at Berkeley High (11.21.14)Op-ed: Sexual harassment at Berkeley High must stop (11.17.14)Berkeley high sexual harassment case close to settling (12.08.11)Berkeley High harassment case heading to settlement [07.21.11]BHS sexual harassment case taken to federal court (04.22.11)Government to assess Berkeley High harassment case (12.07.10)BHS harassment case settles, leaves open questions (10.29.10)BUSD decision appealed in BHS harassment case (9.21.10)Restraining order served on Berkeley High counselor (9.16.10)\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Students ask BUSD for protection for sexual harassment victims", "Tags": "['Berkeley School Board', 'Berkeley Unified School District', 'BHS Stop Harassing', 'Sexual harassment']", "Sections": "['Schools', 'Schools']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley High School", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.868063", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "247813", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.27179", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/10/students-ask-busd-protection-sexual-harassment-victims/", "Author": "Natalie Orenstein", "Date": "2017-02-10T13:20:45-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Erin Schweng.

It appears below in full.\nDear Berkeley High Community,\nIt is with regret that I am writing to say farewell, as I have tendered my resignation as the Berkeley High Principal.\nIt has been an honor to work with such a vibrant community of students, teachers, staff, parents and guardians. Berkeley High has a lot going for it and I will cheer on its continued success and evolution. It was especially meaningful for me to be involved in the Berkeley High redesign, which aimed to better unify the school and to improve outcomes for all students. I was also very impressed by the deeply-felt and peaceful student activism I witnessed during my years there.\nI have the greatest respect for the quality of education at Berkeley High School and the highest regard for the great students there.\nGo Jackets!\nSam Pasarow\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "Pasarow resigns; new Berkeley High principal now in place", "Tags": "['Berkeley High School', 'Berkeley Unified School District', 'Erin Schweng', 'Sam Pasarow']", "Sections": "['Schools', 'Schools']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley High School", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.868063", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "247784", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.27179", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/08/pasarow-resigns-new-berkeley-high-principal-now-place/", "Author": "Emilie Raguso", "Date": "2017-02-08T19:35:48-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Around 5:50 p.m. on Feb. 1, about 150 black-clad protesters stormed the peaceful anti-Milo Yiannopoulos rally. Here they are pulling apart a metal barricade set up to separate protesters from those attending the talk. Photo: Pete RososIn the six days since rioters hijacked a raucous, but peaceful protest against the right-wing speaker Milo Yiannopoulos, many have wondered who those masked marauders actually were. The 100 to 150 people who stormed Sproul Plaza and who UC officials said hurled fireworks, rocks, and Molotov cocktails at police were mostly dressed in black with ski masks or bandanas hiding their faces.\nWere the troublemakers from the left? Or from the right?\nNow the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been called in to help figure it out.\nRead full Berkeleyside coverage of the Milo Yiannopoulos protest.Immediately after the protests, which caused $100,000 in damage to the MLK student union, the Amazon store on its first floor, and at least one tree, UC Berkeley officials described the rioters as acting as a coordinated paramilitary force that had \"essentially raided the campus.\" There were similarities among the rioters that this reporter noticed; many of them carried the same rounded long sticks that they used to hold up flags or, perhaps, to smash windows.\n\n\"They came in a military fashion, they were well-rehearsed,\" said UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof on the night of the protests. \"They seemed armed and dangerous.\"\nAbout 1,500 people were peacefully protesting against Yiannopoulos's scheduled talk in the plaza when the group of black-clad protesters rushed onto campus en masse around 5:50 p.m. Within a few minutes, they had moved the metal barricades set up to create a space for those attending the talk to pass through, and had thrown several of the barriers through ground-floor windows. They also set a generator on fire, providing the dramatic images of the protest that have been flashed around the world. The black-clad protesters then occupied the area nearest the student union for most of the night while others stood on the steps of Sproul Hall or gathered further away.\nLater in the night, the agitators rampaged through downtown Berkeley, damaging numerous banks, a Starbucks, and branches of other national chains. John Caner, head of the Downtown Berkeley Association, said there was an estimated $400,000-$500,000 worth of damage to downtown. There was also some vandalism on Telegraph Avenue, including graffiti, according to Stuart Baker, head of the Telegraph Business Improvement District, but it was relatively minor.\nUC Berkeley Professor Robert Reich speculated on his website that right-wing agitators might have been behind the rioting. He wrote of the \"possibility that Yiannopoulos and Breitbart were in cahoots with the agitators, in order to lay the groundwork for a Trump crackdown on universities and their federal funding.\"\nCNN interviewed Reich on Friday where he said he \"wouldn't bet against\" the possibility that the chaos was deliberately planned by the right. But Reich did not provide any direct evidence of his assertion.\nA Berkeleyside reader also brought up the possibility that those on the right were to blame.\n\"It's a well-known fact that the far right infiltrates social justice movements and events in the hopes of distorting the media's and the public response to the event,\" she wrote. \"I would not be at all surprised if those who came from off-campus (probably from outside the city) were supporters of Milos Yiannopoulos. Whether they came on his behalf or another source, I imagine they are very satisfied with their accomplishment; they had the media (local and national) pretty much eating out of their hands, as far as I can tell.\"\nHowever, much of the media covering the event described the rioters as anarchists or \"black bloc,\" or \"antifa\" -- loose collections of people on the far left who believe creating chaos is the best way to trigger social change. Members of the black bloc have been popping up at protests for several years, ever since the Occupy movement took root.\nWhile 150 \"masked individuals with paramilitary tactics\" hurled Molotov cocktails, set fires, shot fireworks at police and damaged property on Feb. 1, thousands of others demonstrated peacefully on the steps of Sproul Hall bathed in the colors of the LGBTQ movement. Photo: Ted FriedmanAt least one far-left group has publicly acknowledged its participation in the protest, although it has not said it caused property damage. The group, By Any Means Necessary (BAMN), a left-wing group that is often confrontational, has claimed that it was one of the \"organizers of Berkeley's shutdown of white neo-fascist Milo Yiannopoulos.\" One of its leaders, Yvette Felarca, who is also a BUSD middle-school teacher, spoke against Yiannopoulos through a megaphone at the protests, and later told Berkeleyside the chaos and destruction were a \"stunning achievement.\" However, BAMN members, including Felarca, were not dressed in the black \"uniform\" of the most destructive members of the crowd.\nPeople who identify as conservatives and Trump supporters have spent considerable energy on social media and in Berkeleyside's comments section discussing the possible identities of the rioters and who may be funding them. The #Berkeley hashtag on Twitter is clogged with claims and accusations about who caused the destruction. Many argue that the demonstrators were Cal students and that this proves the Free Speech Movement has died. They blame students and the university administration for canceling Yiannopoulos' talk. They are also highly critical of the police's decision to not engage with the protesters but to defend the MLK building from inside instead. (Read our interviews with both the UCPD chief and the BPD chief on their responses to the protesters.)\nSome believe one of those who hit protesters works at UC Berkeley. They have identified him by name on Twitter and online. Breitbart News has listed his name, his Twitter handle and a screenshot of the salary he earns at Cal. As he has not been charged, Berkeleyside is not publishing his name.\n \nPeople who were injured at the Milo Yiannopoulos protest are trying to identify their attackers publishing photographs and offering bounties.Mogulof said UC Police are aware that some have claimed a UC employee was involved and are investigating the charge. He also said the federal government is now assisting with the investigation.\n\"The campus is aware of the allegations involving someone who is a current member of the university's workforce,\" Mogulof wrote in an email. \"UCPD is working in close concert with the FBI on an ongoing investigation into the matter.\"\nThe FBI on Wednesday responded to an email from Berkeleyside requesting information. It confirmed it was in contact with both the Berkeley police and UCPD, but would not confirm or deny an ongoing investigation about the violence that erupted at the protests. The FBI's Prentice Danneriii also noted, by email, that the FBI does \"not open investigations based on First Amendment activities.\"\nIn an unusual twist, a woman who was pepper-sprayed while she was giving an interview is trying to find out the identity of the people she thinks attacked her. The woman, Katrina, identifies herself on Twitter as on the right end of the political spectrum. She was at Cal with her husband and friends to hear Yiannopoulos. She and a female friend were pepper-sprayed and her husband was hit so badly several of his ribs were broken and he had to go to the hospital, she said in an interview with radio host Stefan Molyneux.\nKatrina is trying to find those who attacked her group by crowd-funding a bounty for information leading to their identification. She used a website to ask people to contribute to a fund (the bounty) to track her alleged attackers down. So far, people have contributed $1,272 to locate one of the alleged assailants, and $830 and $500 to find two others. If someone provides the correct information, they will get the money.\n\"Expose this pepper-spraying Antifa Ninja who assaulted an innocent woman,\" reads one of the entries on the site. It continues on another page: \"This criminal, caught red-handed on tape, must be identified, exposed, and turned over to law enforcement and the legal system so that justice can be served.\"\nEditors' note: 1) This article originally had links to the crowd-funded bounty site. We took down the link after a phone call from someone who said it was putting her in danger. 2) This story was updated after publication with information received from the FBI.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "FBI investigating identities of black-clad UC Berkeley rioters", "Tags": "['Berkeley protests', 'By Any Means Necessary', 'Donald Trump', 'UC Berkeley', 'UC Berkeley protests']", "Sections": "['Schools', 'Schools', 'UC Berkeley']", "Natural Language Location": "UC Berkeley", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.869861", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "247555", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.258765", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/07/fbi-investigating-identities-black-clad-uc-berkeley-rioters/", "Author": "Frances Dinkelspiel", "Date": "2017-02-07T15:13:08-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "BUSD will use Measure I funds to renovate Berkeley High School's A Building. Photo: Natalie OrensteinMajor renovations of the Berkeley High School Community Theater and the West Campus are among a series of construction projects planned for the Berkeley Unified School District.\nThe School Board voted Jan. 11 to reallocate the revenue from Measure I, a $210 million bond measure passed by Berkeley voters in 2010. So far, revenue from Measure I has helped complete the Tim Moellering Field, the BHS South of Bancroft stadium project, and other district construction. The new plan redistributes the remaining $112.6 million, previously scheduled for many smaller projects, to a few larger projects to address efficiency issues and increasing enrollment.\nThe biggest ticket item on the new list is the $35 million renovation of the BHS A Building, which houses the Community Theater, the Florence Schwimley Little Theater, and performing arts classrooms. The proposed plan adds five new classrooms to the building.\nPresenting the reallocation plan to the board in November, BUSD facilities director Timothy White said the planned modernization of the Community Theater will \"reestablish that theater as a preeminent\" public venue.\n\n\"But the primary purpose will always be for the education of our students,\" he said.\nUnder the new plan, BHS also gets a new staff parking structure with multi-use athletics courts above it, on the site of the former tennis courts on Milvia Street between Bancroft and Durant.\nThe West Campus at 2020 Bonar St. will be renovated to serve as a temporary school site for classes displaced by construction. Photo: Kaia DiringerAnother large chunk of the money is dedicated to renovating the West Campus at 2020 Bonar St., where the School Board meets. REALM Charter School's high school currently leases part of the building from the district. The board voted Jan. 25 against extending the high school's lease past this academic year. REALM and BUSD had previously agreed to end the lease in June, but REALM later requested to extend it past this year, said BUSD spokesman Charles Burress.\n\"We are planning on Realm relocating by the end of the current lease,\" Burress wrote in an email to Berkeleyside.\nThe modernization of West Campus is designed to enable the  building to serve as a \"swing site\" that will house classes displaced during planned construction at Oxford Elementary and on the BHS A Building. The $10 million Oxford construction project, including the addition of a multipurpose room and new classrooms, is included in the reallocated Measure I plan. All Oxford classes may temporarily relocate to West Campus during that work.\n In November, board members cautioned that the district will have to handle the relocation with care.\n\"One challenge is schools in Berkeley are not used to that sort of large-scale disruption, with the exception of possibly Berkeley High... and Washington,\" board Vice President Josh Daniels said. \"That sort of move without extensive community discussion would likely cause some pushback.\"\n\"It's not unheard of in this district but it's been a long time\" since an entire school was relocated, said Board President Ty Alper. \"Schools can deal with it but it does require a lot of planning and communication.\"\nThe West Campus renovation is also designed to equip the site to serve potentially as a new elementary school in the future. The elementary schools in South Berkeley have accommodated increased enrollment from across the district in recent years because those campuses have the largest combined capacity. The district expects to enroll another 144 students over the next five years because of new residential development. Converting West Campus into a new school with 15 classrooms would provide needed capacity and spread the student body more evenly across the city, White said.\nThe reallocation plan also dedicates $12.5 million to revamping the cafeterias and food service at five elementary schools: Washington, Berkeley Arts Magnet, Malcolm X, Emerson and John Muir.\nThe district's maintenance operation facility at Russell and Oregon Streets is also slated for a $15 million renovation.\nBoth Berkeley High's theaters will get renovated under the new plan. Photo: Natalie OrensteinA chunk of the Measure I funds are dedicated to equipping sites at BHS and other schools for new career technical education (CTE) programs. The programs blend academics and vocational training. BHS currently has CTE programs focused on biotechnology, emergency medical response, fire science, digital media, law, and other occupations, with new programs for stagecraft, carpentry, and electronic technology in development. The Measure I funds will prepare facilities including the Community Theater to house CTE programs.\nIn November, Board Member Karen Hemphill praised the new plan for equipping school facilities to serve multiple purposes and adapt to changes in the district and education landscape.\n\"That's not the way we've tended to look at our construction,\" she said. \"It's been more facility and system replacements, as opposed to looking at: How do our capital projects and major maintenance projects support our educational side of the fence?\"\nThe plan leaves a little more than $5 million unallocated. In the coming months and years, additional funding for facility upgrades could flow in from other sources.\nThe School Board is set to vote in February on whether to collect fees from real estate developers. Unlike many Bay Area districts, BUSD has never collected developer fees, which are intended to mitigate the impact of nearby development on the district.\nThe proposal before the board is a fee of $3.38 per square foot of new development, which is projected to yield around $2.75 million in the next five years. The district's facility needs, including those covered by Measure I funds, amount to $259 million, according to White.\n\"These are fees that developers are used to paying,\" Hemphill said at the Jan. 11 meeting. She argued against the possibility of grandfathering in development that has already been approved but not constructed.\nProposition 51, the $9 billion statewide school construction bond that passed in November, may also bring in additional revenue for BUSD projects, White said.\nWhite and board members discussed planning soon for a follow-up school facilities bond measure for the 2018 or 2020 ballot. That measure could potentially address additional modernization projects, the portables at Washington and Berkeley Arts Magent, and subsidized teacher housing.\n \n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "BUSD paves way for renovated Community Theater, West Campus", "Tags": "['2020 Bonar St.', 'Berkeley High School', 'Berkeley Unified School District', 'BUSD budget']", "Sections": "['Schools', 'Schools']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley High School", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.868063", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "245900", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.27179", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/01/27/busd-paves-way-renovated-community-theater-west-campus/", "Author": "Natalie Orenstein", "Date": "2017-01-27T08:00:27-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Arturo Fernandez is a fourth-year Ph.D. student in statistics at UC Berkeley. Photo: UC Berkeley/Brittany Hosea-SmallBy Anne Brice / Berkeley News\nGrowing up in the 1990s in Pittsburg, California, Arturo Fernandez felt like a typical kid.\nHe rode his bike around the neighborhood with friends, played on his church soccer team, watched the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and played Pokemon on his Gameboy. He loved solving puzzles, and had an affinity for math.\nHe didn't know he was undocumented. And, until recently, he didn't much care.\n\nFernandez was born in Rio Grande, Zacatecas, Mexico, and moved to the U.S. with his family when he was just 3 months old.\nIn middle school, he participated in a program that mentored students in math at the local community college. To get college credit, he needed his Social Security number, so he went to his mom and asked her for it. That's when she told him, \"You don't have one because you weren't born here. You're not a citizen.\"\nFernandez, pictured here with his parents, graduated from UC Berkeley with a double major in applied mathematics and statistics and went on to pursue a Ph.D. in statistics. Photo: Courtesy Arturo FernandezThat was a surprise. But it wasn't a major concern until the election of Donald Trump as president, which has alarmed Fernandez and other undocumented students across the nation.\nDuring Trump's campaign, as part of his platform for immigration reform, he promised to repeal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, an act that would threaten benefits for more than 700,000 young immigrants in the U.S.\nDACA, a 2012 executive order by President Obama, allows children of undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. by their parents to receive temporary protection from deportation, work permits and a path to citizenship if they haven't committed any crimes.\nWhen, or even whether Trump might repeal DACA is unknown. And on Wednesday, Trump suggested he might soften his stance, telling ABC's David Muir: \"We're going to take care of everybody. Where you have great people who are here [and] who have done a good job -- they shouldn't be worried.\" Still,  given the President's unpredictability, that could change.\nStudents would face special hardships, says Meng So, who directs the Undocumented Student Program at UC Berkeley. Without DACA, he says, students would also lose work-study, leaving big holes in their financial aid packages. For graduate students like Fernandez, it would strip them of their tuition and fee remissions for their graduate research.\nSo also points to students' heightened fears about what the government will do with the personal information they were required to provide when they applied for DACA.\nStanding with students\nAs a high school student, Fernandez had one clear goal: Go to college. Working with a teacher and school counselor who helped him with college applications and finding scholarships open to undocumented students, Fernandez applied to 20 schools in California and was accepted to nearly all of them. He decided on UC Berkeley -- the best decision he's made, he says -- and started in fall 2008.\nBut life as an undocumented college student turned out to be tougher than he thought. His classes were rigorous and demanding, and he was under immense financial strain. He was paying in-state tuition, thanks to a state law passed in 2001, and he'd received several private scholarships, but UC raised tuition at the end of his first year and suddenly the scholarships weren't enough. (At the time, college students couldn't apply for financial aid through the state, as they now can under the 2011 California Dream Act.) The 18-year-old wondered if he'd taken on too much.\n\"Losing DACA would be like going backwards in time, instead of moving forward, like you thought you'd be\"\"It was really hard,\" he says. \"Like a lot of students at Berkeley, I was trying to find my footing. Then, on top of that, I kind of had an identity crisis of what it meant to be undocumented. I'd lived in California my whole life, but I wasn't a citizen. I grew up thinking, 'I am America's child.' But then you get to an age where you can't be.\"\nStruggling with his identity, unsure how he fit into his community, he knew he had to finish what he set out to do. He recommitted himself to a subject he'd been enamored of since he was a kid. \"I fell in love with statistics,\" he says.\nIn 2012, Fernandez was set to graduate from Berkeley with a double major in applied mathematics and statistics. But as an undocumented student, he wasn't legally allowed to work, and pursuing a career in his field seemed like a far-off dream. \"It was hard not knowing what my future would look like,\" he says.\nMeng So (right) is the director of the Undocumented Student Program at UC Berkeley, which provides resources for the 470 undocumented students on campus. Photo: UC Berkeley/Brittany Hosea-SmallTwo months before commencement, however, a new path emerged. He had received a reprieve: He had been approved for DACA.\nFor Fernandez, it meant he could continue his education in statistics by funding his Ph.D. research working as a graduate student instructor on campus.\n\"With DACA, I was hungry,\" he says. \"I was hungry to develop myself professionally and learn as much as I could.\"\nBut he couldn't do it alone. He needed the help of Berkeley's Undocumented Student Program, which provides services to the 470 undocumented students on campus, from academic counseling to mental health support to legal advice. So, the program's director, worked with Fernandez to find resources and apply to Berkeley's competitive Ph.D. statistics program. Along with a cohort of eight others, he was accepted and began the following fall.\n\"We must prioritize courage over comfort and keep moving forward in a direction of growth and compassion.\"Fernandez flourished as a Ph.D. student. In addition to a job as a graduate student instructor, he worked with the program's legal team to apply to travel abroad to conferences and attend research summer schools, expanding his professional network and scope of research.\nHe also a got a driver's license -- something he'd wanted for a long time, but was ineligible for -- which added a layer of ease to his life he had never known.\nFernandez could feel himself returning to the kid he'd been in high school -- proud of who he was and outspoken about his undocumented status. \"Berkeley grad school has slowly given me that voice back,\" he says. Now he worries the Trump White House will try to silence him and millions of other non-citizens.\nWhile it remains unclear what changes the new administration will make, the Undocumented Student Program's legal team says in a post-election FAQ that it's highly likely DACA will be quickly rescinded.\nIn November, UC President Janet Napolitano said in a statement that UC's 10 campuses will \"protect the privacy and civil rights of undocumented students and will continue to welcome and support students, regardless of their immigration status.\"\nAnd the Undocumented Student Program promises to do what it takes to support these students. \"We're going to stand with our students,\" says So. \"We're going to fight with them. We're going to prioritize the highest degree of safety and security for them and their families.\"\n\"Losing DACA would be like going backwards in time,\" says Fernandez. \"Instead of moving forward, like you thought you'd be -- establishing your life, settling down, moving forward -- now it feels like a lot of that is being taken away from you.\"\nSo, however, says his program's commitment to students and their families remains steadfast, and promises to do what it takes to support them.\n\"We must prioritize courage over comfort\" he says, \"and keep moving forward in a direction of growth and compassion.\"\nLearn more about the Undocumented Student Program.\n\nThis article was first published by UC Berkeley on Jan. 25.\n", "Coder Initials": "SS", "Title": "For undocumented Cal students, Trump era brings fear, uncertainty", "Tags": "['Donald Trump', 'Immigration', 'UC Berkeley']", "Sections": "['Schools', 'Schools', 'UC Berkeley']", "Natural Language Location": "UC Berkeley", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.869861", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "246060", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.258765", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/01/26/for-undocumented-students-at-uc-berkeley-trump-era-brings-fear-uncertainty/", "Author": "Guest contributor", "Date": "2017-01-26T13:56:18-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Berkeley High principal Sam Pasarow went on sudden paid leave Dec. 6. No explanation was offered to the school community, with the district citing confidentiality reasons. Photo: Mark CoplanThe Berkeley PTA Council has launched a petition demanding that the school district explain why Berkeley High principal Sam Pasarow went on abrupt leave on Dec. 6.\nThe council petition also states that if a \"solid\" or \"credible\" reason for Pasarow's leave cannot be given, BUSD should reinstate him.\n\"We're standing up for our students and their families and we want to do what's right,\" said Christine Staples, president of the Berkeley PTA Council, which represents school parent-teacher associations across the district. Staples said all sorts of rumors have been circulating since Berkeley Unified announced on Dec. 5 in an email that Pasarow would be on leave, effective the following day, without providing an explanation. \"We need an update,\" she said. \"It's not healthy for our community to go without information: it harms the community and it harms the principal who we respect.\"\nThe online petition was launched on Dec. 29 and has drawn more than 260 signatures so far.\n\nBUSD Assistant Superintendent Pasquale Scuderi wrote in the December email that the district could not provide any details as it was bound to \"respect confidentiality whenever private or personnel matters arise,\" but acknowledged that the lack of information might be concerning.\nSpeaking before the holidays, Ty Alper, President of the BUSD School Board, also referred to the difficulty of not being able to comment on Pasarow's case. \"I am fully aware it's disconcerting and frustrating for the community,\" he said. \"But I strongly believe in the right to privacy.\"\nPasarow, the former principal at Oakland middle school Edna Brewer, has been the Berkeley High principal for just 16 months. He assumed the position in July 2015, replacing Scuderi, who was principal for four years. During his tenure, Pasarow has been praised for his deft handling of the discovery of a racist message on a library computer, numerous school walkouts, including those connected to the racist message and the election of Donald Trump, and an examination of how to close the school's achievement gap.\nPasarow has been criticized, however, for \"bullying\" staff. The school has also come under fire for not responding sufficiently well to sexual harassment claims.\nErin Schweng, Berkeley High's executive vice principal, was named Dec. 6 to take over as the school's lead administrator.\nAlper said he was confident in the administrative team at BHS and that the school was \"moving forward with business as usual.\" \"We will provide information of some kind at some point,\" he added.\nBUSD Superintendent Donald Evans suggested that communication about Pasarow, who is on paid leave, might be forthcoming later this month. In an end-of-year email sent out Dec. 30, he acknowledged \"the continued questions and concern\" about Pasarow's \"unanticipated\" leave. \"We recognize that unfortunately there have been rumors and speculation around the circumstances of the leave, but the confidentiality rules around personnel matters make it impossible for us to provide additional details at this time,\" he wrote. \"We truly appreciate the messages of concern and support for the school and for the Principal ... We hope to update the community again in mid-January, and, meanwhile, have absolute confidence in our leadership team's ability to guide BHS in the interim.\"\nA Berkeley High teacher, who asked to remain anonymous, said the rumor mill had been \"swirling\" since Pasarow's departure, but that Schweng was \"doing a great job in Sam's absence and things are carrying on more or less as normal.\"\nStaples said four members of the six-strong PTA Council are Berkeley High parents. All of them know and have worked with Pasarow, and think \"very highly\" of him. She said she, along with many parents, was impressed with how Pasarow managed the student protest in November 2015 that followed a racist hate crime on campus.\n\"Pasarow supported the students, he empowered them to lead and marched with them,\" she said. \"The same thing happened with the protest the day after election -- not only are the students being supported, they aren't being punished. They are being encouraged to be leaders and activists and he's keeping it safe.\" Staples said the school climate -- around issues like racism and building a stronger feeling of community -- had improved since Pasarow took the helm, and that his contribution to the BHS Design Team working to overhaul scheduling and classes to reduce the student achievement gap, had been valuable.\nL to r: Sam Pasarow, Hasmig Minassian and Tamara Friedman, met in the spring to discuss restructuring the BHS curriculum in order to reduce the high school's achievement gap. They were part of the 35-member BHS Design Team. Photo: Frances DinkelspielBut Pasarow has also come in for serious criticism. At the Nov. 16 School Board meeting, union leader Paula Phillips, president of the Berkeley Council of Classified Employees, accused him of bullying district staff, particularly employees of color, and of creating a hostile environment for staff and an unsafe environment for students.\n\"Sam Pasarow has displayed bullying behavior ... to include verbal threats of discipline over the radio; non-verbal threats, to include staring, stalking our classified employees; emotional terrorism, such as terrorizing, defaming, intimidating and humiliating our classifying employees,\" Phillips said, addressing the board. \"And what's sad about this behavior is that it's been inflicted on the African-American classified employees in particular, both male and female.\"\nPhillips said the union had talked to both Scuderi and Pasarow about these issues, to which Pasarow had responded that he wanted \"to do what he wanted to do.\" Phillips said Pasarow had lowered the morale of safety officers, as on-campus safety issues brought to his attention had not been resolved. [Watch video of Phillips addressing the board, beginning at 8:00 minutes.]\nAttempts by Berkeleyside to reach Phillips for further comment have proved unsuccessful.\nThe district, and Berkeley High in particular, have also come under fire in recent months for their handling of at least one sexual harassment complaint -- that of Aniya Williams, who spoke at the Dec. 7 School Board meeting, as did her allies, and her father.  [Watch video, beginning at 1:04:40 mark]-- and one lawsuit, filed on Nov. 21 regarding a 16-year-old female Berkeley High student who says the school mishandled her complaint of sexual harassment.\nComplaints about the handling of sexual harassment within BUSD are not new. Advocates have been working to raise awareness about sexual harassment faced by Berkeley Unified students for many years, saying the school district has not done enough to respond to problems faced by students, or comply with mandatory rules. [Read more about the BHS Stop Harassing group and its work.]\nIn early 2015, the federal Office for Civil Rights launched an investigation into whether BUSD inadequately responded to sexual harassment claims at Berkeley High, thereby creating a \"hostile environment on the basis of sex.\" Failure to adequately respond to sexual harassment claims is a federal offense under Title IX.\nAsked about the sexual harassment cases, Alper said the district was still under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights. He also said it was worth remembering that a school district is typically handling \"any number of complaints\" and \"several lawsuits\" of different kinds at any one time. \"The important thing is that we handle them in a timely manner, with accountable procedures and that people feel they well handled,\" he said.\nIn a Dec. 15 email to the BHS community, Schweng referenced \"recent incidents,\" and reminded staff and families of the importance of talking to students about sexual harassment and bullying.\nIn early December, District Compliance Officer and Title IX coordinator, Beverley Bueno, left her job after less than a year working for the district. It is not known whether she was fired or left voluntarily and the district won't comment since it is a personnel matter. Her Title IX duties -- which include helping to create and maintain a supportive, equitable and safe environment for all students  -- have been assumed by Susan Craig, Director of Student Services.\nAlper said many districts the size of BUSD don't have a full-time Title IX coordinator, and that it's a \"hybrid\" position. He conceded the district was persuaded to have one, \"in large part due to advocacy from our students.\"\nThe school district underwent a federal audit in 2016, that covered several of its schools, including Berkeley High. The report was published in October. Berkeley High was found to be non-compliant on several legal matters relating to sex equity (section 4), but the items appear to mainly relate to the need for correct documentation. [Read the full audit.]\nThe district is also handling a lawsuit for allegedly conducting racially targeted interviews to intimidate Latino, African-American and immigrant students -- including several from Berkeley High -- from exercising their free speech rights, as well as legal action by Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School teacher Yvette Felarca who was put on paid leave after her political actions raised concerns.\nMeanwhile, Staples said the PTA Council is trying to gather as many signatures as possible on its petition about Pasarow in what she referred to as a \"vacuum of information.\"\n\"The next board meeting is not for another couple of weeks,\" she said -- it's on Jan. 11 -- \"and we're nervous that they might do something like terminate him. We would like him to be reinstated.\"\nEds: This story was updated with a correction after publication to reflect the fact that BUSD did not directly relate Yvette Felarca being put on leave with her political actions.\nRelated:Berkeley High principal on sudden leave, VP in charge (12.05.16)Sam Pasarow named as new Berkeley High principal (04.09.15)New BHS principal: School district seeks community input (01.08.15)Kristin Glenchur named Berkeley High interim principal (06.13.14) BHS principal Scuderi moves to assistant superintendent (05.01.14)Illegal enrollment is boon and burden to Berkeley schools (04.08.14)Berkeley High expands with the opening of a new building (03.19.14)New Berkeley superintendent Donald Evans: \"This is my ministry\" (07.11.13)Pasquale Scuderi on his first year as head of Berkeley High (07.07.11)\nDo you rely on Berkeleyside for your local news?

Photo: Pat Johnson StudiosElizabeth Farnsworth is a filmmaker, foreign correspondent, and former chief correspondent and principal substitute anchor of PBS' NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. Her 2008 documentary, The Judge and the General, co-directed with Patricio Lanfranco, aired on television around the world, winning many awards. She has reported from Cambodia, Vietnam, Chile, Haiti, Iraq, and Iran, among other countries. She grew up in Topeka, Kansas, where her ancestors were pioneers, and lives in Berkeley.\nFarnsworth recently published a memoir, A Train Through Time: A Life, Real and Imagined, that weaves a child's imaginative adventures with vivid memories from her reporting in conflicted countries like Haiti or Cambodia.\nMichael Chabon said the book \"broke his heart.\" \"It has been a long time since I read a book so moving, plain-spoken and beautiful. The instant I finished it, I went back to the beginning and started in again,\" the Pulitzer Prize-winning author, also a Berkeley resident, wrote.\nBerkeleyside asked Farnsworth about what inspired her to write the book and about the experience of moving from journalist to memoirist.\n\nWhy did you choose to write a memoir?\nLike most journalists, I have usually focused on the lives of others and not on myself. I preferred that, and it was more or less mandatory at the The NewsHour, where I worked for 20 years.\nJim Lehrer used to say that we had failed if viewers noticed us - the anchors or reporters - rather than the people we were covering.\nI never intended to write a memoir, but some years ago, I had a powerful encounter at Skywalker Ranch, where the soundscapes of hundreds of films were created. (I was there overseeing the audio mix of a documentary film.) The encounter, which I describe in the first pages of my book, set off a cascade of memories in my mind - from conflicted places like Iraq to a train trip with my father after a tragedy struck our family when I was nine.\nMy friend, the poet Brenda Hillman, encouraged me to write about the encounter and the memories. I did what she advised, and it became A Train Through Time.\nThe book is not chronological but moves back and forth in time. How did you decide on this structure?\nAs I wrote, I understood that I was struggling to understand how events long ago might have led to reporting from danger zones. It felt like I was speaking as a child across the years to myself as an adult, and vice versa. The memories did not come to mind chronologically. I can't explain why the first \"fragment,\" as Brenda Hillman called the short pieces I would eventually put together, came from a 1993 shoot in a Khmer Rouge-controlled part of Cambodia. As I was writing, I flashed back and forth in time. Brenda Hillman encouraged me to structure the book that way. Otherwise, I wouldn't have dared to do it.\nThe book occasionally blends reality and imagination. This is fairly unusual for a journalist. Why did you do it?\nMost of the events in the book actually happened, but when writing about the trip with my father from Topeka to San Francisco -- and especially as we neared the Sierra Nevada -- I was surprised to feel memory yielding to imagination. (I've learned that the two are closely linked.) For a while in the book, the trip becomes wondrous, almost magical. Jim Lehrer read an early version of the manuscript and recommended that I explain in an afterword when and why the imagining began. As readers will see, I followed Jim's advice.\nNone of the reporting in the book from around the world is imagined. I checked those memories against notes and video and asked colleagues who had traveled with me to fact-check what I wrote.\nYour memories of your childhood are often very clear. Did you find it hard to remember your past?\nSome events from my childhood feel permanently burned into my memory. I think the reader will recognize them in the book. They feel intense, illuminated. I wonder if my loss as a child explains why I remember some of those events so vividly.\nI'm lucky to have boxes full of records of my childhood, including short stories submitted to Seventeen magazine (and never published), letters from summer camp, photographs, and, best of all, a few of my diaries. Perhaps writing every night about the day's events helps keep them alive in our memories forever.\nSometimes I've had to improvise. For example, I remember the street in St. Louis where the friend I met on the train lived -- Tulip Lane -- but I am not sure of her name. I think it was Sally, and that's what I call her in the book, but I could be wrong.\nI imagined some of the long-ago dialogue in the book but not the most significant conversations. I remembered them almost word for word.\nYou vividly depict the dangers of covering conflicts and people like General Augusto Pinochet. Did you nevertheless love your work?\nYes, in spite of the dangers, I loved my work. Robin MacNeil, Jim Lehrer, executive producer Lester M. Crystal, and deputy executive producer Linda Winslow are talented, dedicated and generous-spirited people, and they provided inspired leadership for me and the rest of the NewsHour staff. Each of those leaders has now retired. The program suffered a grievous loss when Gwen Ifill died, a loss still deeply felt, but Judy Woodruff, executive producer Sara Just, and the rest of the staff are keeping the standards very high. I think the program is excellent these days.\nVisit Elizabeth Farnsworth's website for more about her book and related eventsYou talked recently at a book event about the responsibility you feel as an American producer for the drivers and \"fixers\" (local field producers/translators) who sometimes took risks working for you. Tell us more about that.\nThis issue is a major part of the book, because I quit reporting from dangerous places when they got too dangerous for crews and the local independent reporters/producers (fixers) we hire to interpret, get interviews, and help keep us safe. A camera can be mistaken for a gun. The sound technician is busy gathering audio and may not see danger when it comes. And the local fixer is potentially the most endangered of us all. He or she will be blamed if we report something a local despot doesn't like. I am relieved that in recent years the Committee to Protect Journalists and others are increasingly recognizing and publicizing the courage and contributions of fixers in Iraq, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, and other dangerous places.\nI'm glad that I could call attention in my book to the dangers for crews and fixers, and I am deeply grateful to editor Jack Shoemaker and others at Counterpoint Press for publishing the work. I also want to mention my talented friend Mark Serr, who created the photo art in the book.

Image has been digitally retouched.By Joel Bahr / UC Berkeley\nThe extensive body of work of an artist and illustrator whose subjects spanned some of the most profound events of the 20th century will be available to the world in a public institution for the first time, thanks to a $10.1 million gift from Bay Area-based Taube Philanthropies to The Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life at the University of California, Berkeley. The Taube grant is the largest single monetary gift to acquire art in the history of the campus.\nThis gift provides students, scholars and the public access to the most significant collection of works by Arthur Szyk, a Polish Jewish artist and political caricaturist who ultimately settled in the U.S. in 1940. Szyk used motifs drawn from the Bible, history, politics and culture to pair extraordinary craftsmanship with insightful commentary on a diverse range of subjects including Judaism, the founding of the State of Israel, the American War of Independence, World War II, and the Holocaust.\nTaube Philanthropies' $10.1 million gift to acquire the Szyk collection is a continuation of its support for UC Berkeley in making exemplary Jewish art and culture accessible to wider audiences. In 2010, support by the foundation through a $250,000 grant helped ensure the transfer of the 15,000-item collection, formerly known as the Judah L. Magnes Museum, to its current home at Berkeley, where it has thrived as The Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life. The new gift is also the largest single monetary gift in the area of Jewish studies in the campus's history.\n\nThe latest gift, the voluminous Szyk collection, now known as the Taube Family Arthur Szyk Collection, is moving from a private owner to a world-class university, exposing new generations to a major artist whose work is drawing significant interest in the art world, decades after his death. The Magnes -- which holds the third-largest Jewish museum collection in the U.S., and the only one of such size in the world housed at a research university -- is particularly well suited to study and showcase Szyk's work.\n\"Madness\" New York, 1941\"Arthur Szyk's unique contributions to contemporary art and political illustration have not yet been recognized to the extent his work deserves,\" said Tad Taube, chairman of Taube Philanthropies. \"With our shared Polish Jewish heritage, and a relationship my parents developed with Szyk upon first arriving in the United States from Poland in the early 1940s, it is significant to me to ensure that Szyk's remarkable works are available to today's and future generations. Through our philanthropic activities at Taube Philanthropies, we hope to create entrepreneurial opportunities. The elevation of Szyk's diverse, intricate portrayals of European, American and Jewish history, and anti-Nazi political propaganda, in the superb academic setting of UC Berkeley provides an ideal venue for Szyk's monumental collection.\"\nAdded UC Berkeley Helen Fawcett Professor of History Tom Laqueur, \"It's really pretty rare for a single institution to have, essentially, the entire corpus of an important artist's work, in addition to a vast trove of documentary material -- which is to say his diaries, financial records, commissions. Arthur Szyk was an important political artist, as well as an important Jewish artist, who captured and commented on significant world events in his art.\"\"Arthur Szyk operated simultaneously in many countries, cultures and languages, and he was a refugee for a good part of his life,\" said Francesco Spagnolo, curator of The Magnes Collection. \"The Magnes is committed to exploring and documenting the cultures of Jews in the global diaspora, and this collection furthers that goal. Our curatorial task -- and the academic task of the larger Berkeley community -- is to thoroughly examine every aspect of Szyk's work and place it in proper context.\"\nBorn into a middle-class Polish Jewish family in 1894, Szyk lived a life framed by two world wars, the rise of totalitarianism in Europe, and the birth of the State of Israel, before his death in 1951. Much of his work centered around these historical experiences. Szyk was raised in Poland, educated in France, traveled to the Middle East and North Africa, and lived in London and Canada before moving to New York in 1940, where he met Taube's family.\nWhile much of Szyk's art is stylistically reminiscent of medieval and Renaissance traditions, many of his works reflect the social and political unease that gripped the world during his lifetime. A harsh critic of Hitler and Nazi totalitarianism, a number of his most famous pieces portray what Szyk called the \"madness\" of his times.\n\"My People. Samson in the Ghetto (The Battle of the Warsaw Ghetto)\" New York, 1945\"Coming under the stewardship of The Magnes as the Taube Family Arthur Szyk Collection will mean greater access for the general public to Szyk's work, opening the door to academic research and scholarship by individuals at Berkeley and beyond, as well as collaborative partnerships,\" said George Breslauer, UC Berkeley's former Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost who now serves as director of The Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life.\nThe newly acquired collection represents a range of Szyk's artistic activities, including many of his most valuable works. They include 450 artworks, comprising paintings, drawings and sketches from across the artist's lifespan. Accompanying Szyk's artwork in the collection is a wealth of documents, including books, newspapers, magazines and other publications that featured the artist's work.\nThese partnerships include a portion of the collection being sent on loan to the New York Historical Society for a major exhibition opening in September, potential international museum collaborations and cooperation with the Digital Humanities initiatives at UC Berkeley.\nThis story was first published by UC Berkeley on April 3, 2017.\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "Work of major artist comes to UC Berkeley with largest ever monetary gift", "Tags": "['Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life', 'UC Berkeley']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'UC Berkeley']", "Natural Language Location": "2121 Allston Way", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.869795", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "253724", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2690587", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/04/06/work-major-artist-comes-uc-berkeley-largest-ever-monetary-gift/", "Author": "Guest contributor", "Date": "2017-04-06T07:00:06-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Jaclyn Jose in Ma'Rosa: \"a satisfying slice of neo-realism\"The 60th San Francisco International Film Festival plants its flag in Berkeley on Thursday, April 6, with almost 30 different films screening at Pacific Film Archive through Sunday, April 16. Over the next two weeks I'll be pointing you toward some of the festival's most intriguing selections, but be sure to visit SFIFF's online schedule for the full menu - I'm sure to have overlooked something.\nAn examination of police corruption and the drug trade, Filipino director Brillante Mendoza's dramatic feature Ma'Rosa (screening at 6 p.m. on Saturday, Apr. 8) was presumably completed before President Rodrigo Duterte's election victory last May. There's no evidence here of the \"anti-drug\" dirty war that's since followed, with the film focusing instead on the routine deal-making and backstabbing that lie at the heart of the trade.\nWith the help of their three teenage children, Rosa (Jaclyn Jose) and Nestor (Julio Diaz) run a convenience store in the slums of Manila. Their profit doesn't come from candy and cigarettes, however, it comes from the crystal methamphetamine - colloquially known as \"ice\" - they peddle under the counter.\nAfter a neighbor snitches on them, Rosa and Nestor are arrested and their merchandise seized. The police generously offer to make the whole thing go away in exchange for the name of the family's supplier and 50,000 pesos in 'bail money', which the children are hurriedly despatched to collect by any means necessary.\n\nIn the Duterte era, it's easy to imagine Nestor - and perhaps even Rosa - ending up dead after \"resisting arrest,\" but even if real life has passed it by, Ma'Rosa remains a satisfying slice of neo-realism. Anchored by Jose's defiant performance as the tough-as-nails matriarch, it's a festival highlight.\nA scene from World Without End (no reported incidents)Screening at 6:30 p.m. on festival opening day, Thursday, Apr. 6, World Without End (no reported incidents) is a curious but engaging filmic essay from documentarian Jem Cohen, who recently delivered PFA's annual Les Blank Lecture. Shot in Southend-on-Sea, a damp English seaside resort, the film blends lingering shots of nature, glimpses of nearby industrial wasteland Canvey Island, and interviews with locals, including a nationally renowned curry chef, a hat salesman who explains the relationship between millinery and the class system, and a particularly clueless schoolboy.\nThere's also a lengthy segment on the local music scene featuring Chris Fenwick, long-time manager of pub rock legends Dr. Feelgood. If you enjoyed such films as Oil City Confidential or The Ecstasy of Wilko Johnson, World Without End offers further thoughts on what makes Essex, Essex.\nEric Ruffin and Chloe Levine in The TransfigurationIt's not often that horror films get non-specialized film festival airings, but The Transfiguration - fresh off its 'Un Certain Regard' nomination at Cannes -- is a worthy exception. Screening at 8:15 p.m. on Sunday, April 9, it's perhaps best described as a cross between Midnight Cowboy and George Romero's classic chiller Martin, with Milo -- a young man with a vampire fixation (Eric Ruffin) -- and his emotionally vulnerable neighbor Sophie (Chloe Levine) standing in for Ratso and Joe Buck.\nGenre fans will appreciate the film's many movie references, as well as cameo appearances by horror icons Larry Fessenden and Lloyd Kaufman. And if you miss it at the festival, don't worry - The Transfiguration will be rolling into art-houses soon.\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "Big Screen Berkeley: 60th San Francisco International Film Festival", "Tags": "['Big Screen Berkeley', 'Movies']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'Movies']", "Natural Language Location": "BAMPFA", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8707845", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "253525", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2686016", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/04/05/big-screen-berkeley-60th-san-francisco-international-film-festival/", "Author": "John Seal", "Date": "2017-04-05T07:00:59-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Ruth Davies, Pamela Rose, Pat Wilder and Kristen Strom sing as part of the show Blues is a Woman at Freight and Salvage on March 30. Photo: Jane HigginsBy Lee Hildebrand\n\"Everybody says the blues is a man and his guitar,\" saxophonist, clarinetist, and vocalist Kristen Strom said sarcastically during Blues Is a Woman, the title song of singer-songwriter's Pamela Rose's magnificent multimedia show that took place on March 30 at Freight & Salvage.\nStrom's tongue-in-cheek remark followed a series of different definitions of the musical genre by the other cast members: Rose, pianist Tammy Hall, guitarist Pat Wilder, bassist Ruth Davies and drummer Daria Johnson, all of whom also sang. Jayne Wenger is the show's creative director.\n\"The blues is when my car won't start,\" one said. \"The blues is my slave-driving boss,\" stated another. \"The blues is about that man of mine,\" one woman added, prompting another to counter, \"that woman of mine.\"\n\nCatch \"Blues is a Woman\" at the Custom Made Theatre in San Francisco through August.There is, however, some truth in Strom's statement. Men, particularly those who play guitar, have dominated the blues world at least since the 1930s. But during the previous decade, when blues songs performed by African Americans were first captured on wax, women ruled on records and on the black vaudeville circuit run by the white-owned Theater Operators Booking Association (TOBA). Rose pointed out during the two-hour show that it was also called \"Tough on Black Asses\" by performers of the period.\nThe women who performed what is now known as \"classic blues\" during the '20s were royalty in the African-American community. Bessie Smith was \"Empress of the Blues.\" Mamie Smith and Clara Smith (neither related to Bessie) were \"Queen of the Blues\" and \"Queen of the Moaners,\" respectively.\nDaria Johnson, the drummer, sings a song. Ruth Davies is in the background. Photo: Jane HigginsBlues Is a Woman: From Ma Rainey to Bonnie Raitt (the show's full title) is something of an outgrowth of Rose's earlier multimedia presentation, Wild Women of Song, which focused on female composers of jazz, pop and blues songs. The two numbers that the Los Angeles-born, San Francisco-based vocalist composed for the current production - \"Blues Is a Woman\" and \"Blues Is a Mighty River\" - also demonstrate that Rose herself is a first-rate tunesmith.\nThe Bay Area has been home to other woman-led blues revues in the past, from Maxine Howard's Women in the Blues in the '80s to the Blues Broads and Rhonda Benin's annual Just Like a Woman at Freight & Salvage in recent times. Blues Is a Woman is much more than a musical revue, however. Rose calls her show, which incorporates music, scripted dialogue, photographs and film projected onto a screen above the stage, a \"theatrical concert.\"\nThe use of vocal harmony on almost every one of the show's 24 tunes also sets it apart from previous projects. Old songs such as Sippie Wallace's \"Up the Country Blues,\" Peggy Lee's \"You Was Right, Baby\" and Memphis Minnie's \"Looking the World Over\" took on new life through the addition of harmonies that were at times reminiscent of Sweet Honey in the Rock. Johnson's reading of Clara Smith's \"Nobody Knows the Way I Feel This Morning\" over Hall's churchy piano chords and the ensemble's vocal blend was deeply soulful. The urgency of her improvised vamp, which jumped an octave on the song's coda, elicited spontaneous applause from the near-capacity audience. Additional freshness came courtesy of frequent a cappella interludes, as well as from occasional rumba-boogie and funk grooves.\nTammy Hall, at the piano, is also the musical director for the show Blues is a Woman. Pamela Rose, far right, conceived of the show. Photo: Irene YoungAll the women, save for Davies, took turns trading solo, duo and trio leads. Rose was at the helm much of the time, applying her powerful alto tones and refined phrasing to such numbers as Ma Rainey's \"Don't Fish in My Sea,\" Alberta Hunter's \"Remember My Name\" and Ruth Brown's \"Mama He Treats Your Daughter Mean.\" She sometimes mimicked the phasing of others, including Sophie Tucker's unique Yiddish take on Alberta Hunter's blues style during the Sheldon Brooks song \"Some of These Days\" and her syllable repetitions on Janis Joplin's version of Big Mama Thornton's \"Ball and Chain.\" The latter song featured a blistering feedback-fueled guitar solo by Wilder. Hall, the group's musical director, brought the house down with her two-fisted blues and boogie-woogie piano solos throughout the evening and also revealed herself to be a quite fine singer, something she too-rarely does in public.\nOccasional dashes of humor laced the proceedings with such double-entendre numbers as \"Don't Fish in My Sea,\" Wilder and Strom's reading of Ida Cox's \"One Hour Mama\" and Wilder's treatment of Dinah Washington's \"Big Long Sliding Thing\" on which she left out the line about a trombone being the alleged subject. And Rose recalled Sippie Wallace having once said, \"My teeth are so far apart, I had to sip everything.\"\nThe central subject matter of the show is quite serious, however. Besides countering the widespread misconception that the blues is essentially the province of men, the work serves as a long overdue lesson that traces the music's history in chronological order, from its roots in West Africa and its incubation in slavery to the time of terror that followed the end of Reconstruction through the ongoing exploitation of African-American performers by record companies and promoters. Bringing the story more up-to-date was a black-and-white video of Nina Simone singing and playing her angry, anti-racist \"Backlash Blues\" after which the ensemble broke into Aretha Franklin's version of Otis Redding's \"Respect\" on which the word \"freedom\" was given extra emphasis.\nAlthough blues is an art form that was devised, developed and long dominated by African Americans, Rose, who is Caucasian, took the seldom-explored step of tracing the roles played by white women in the music. Some may find it politically incorrect, but Tucker, Lee, Joplin and Raitt are all given props.\nNames of the many female blues artists celebrated in Blues is a Woman showWith Blues Is a Woman, Pamela Rose has created a musically compelling, wonderfully entertaining, educationally informative and at times daring work that imaginatively crosses the lines between concert and theater.\nThe show is slated to run four nights a week throughout August at the Custom Made Theatre in San Francisco.\nLee Hildebrand has been writing about music in the Bay Area and beyond since 1968 and is the author of \"Hammertime\" (Avon Books, 1992) and \"Stars of Soul and Rhythm & Blues\" (Billboard Books, 1994).

Photo: Courtesy the artistsAt first glance, the UC Theatre's Saturday double bill of the psychedelic Los Angeles combo Dengue Fever and Mali's iconic desert rocker Tinariwen might seem like an ill-fitting pairing. But a closer look reveals that both bands grew out of calamities that continue to reverberate.\nKeyboardist Ethan Holtzman launched Dengue Fever with his brother, guitarist and vocalist Zac Holtzman, in 2001 after a mixtape he purchased in Phnom Penh sparked his imagination. Cambodia isn't usually associated with giddy, psychedelic pop music, but in the late 1960s and early 70s the Southeast Asian nation turned into a rock 'n' roll hothouse inflamed by the surf riffs, soul, and garage-band hits broadcast by U.S. Armed Forces Radio to American troops in neighboring Vietnam.\nIn adapting songs by Khmer pop icons like Ros Sereysothea, Sinn Sisamouth, and Pan Ron, the brothers set out to find a vocalist who could sing the original lyrics, a search that brought them to Long Beach's bustling Cambodian community. They quickly encountered Chhom Nimol performing in a karaoke bar. A vivacious vocalist from a famous musical family, she had come to California to perform at a Cambodian New Year's celebration in 2000, and after about two years was ready to move on.\n\"People from Canada, Australia and France wanted me to sing there,\" Nimol told me in a 2011 interview from her home Long Beach. \"A label in Cambodia wanted me to make a record. But my sister lives here, and some of my old friends. They said you came here already, why go back? That's when Zac and Ethan came looking for me.\"\n\nWith bassist Senon Williams, drummer Paul Smith, and David Ralicke on saxophones, flutes and various brass instruments, Dengue Fever released an eponymous album in 2003 covering hits from Cambodia's golden age of pop, all sung in Khmer. With groovy Farfisa organ lines and stinging surf rock guitar licks, the band introduced a singular sound that was both comfortingly familiar and enticingly exotic.\n\nRather than simply plunder Cambodian pop, Dengue Fever has increasingly taken on the music's weighty history. In 2005, the band performed around Cambodia, a tour that allowed Nimol to reconnect with her fans while celebrating a generation of artists who were almost completely wiped out by the Khmer Rouge's genocide in the mid-1970s. John Pirozzi's 2007 documentary Sleepwalking Through the Mekong captured the triumphant tour, and helped raise awareness of the enduring scars left by the killing fields.\nIn 2010 Dengue Fever toured widely promoting the release of Electric Cambodia (Minky Records), a CD featuring 14 vintage Cambodian pop tunes culled from the Holtzman's precious stash of cassettes. The album's proceeds go to Cambodian Living Arts, an organization dedicated to reviving Cambodian traditional art forms and supporting contemporary artistic expression.\n\"As far as we know none [of the musicians on the CD] survived the genocide,\" said bassist Senon Williams. \"If you were famous for making this music, you were first to get a knock on the door, along with architects, professors, doctors, lawyers, artists and politicians.\"\nThe band has continued to absorb new influences, adding Afrobeat grooves into the mix after performing several concerts with Seun Kuti and Egypt 80. It'll be interesting to hear what impact Tinariwen has on Dengue Fever.\nMali's most famous rock band emerged out of a military camp in the in Libya, where many Tuaregs found refuge in the mid-1980s after a devastating drought almost wiped out the age-old desert way of life, killing off camels and goats and forcing most Tuareg to settle in cities. Exposed to the music of Bob Dylan, Bob Marley and various Moroccan rock bands, guitarists Ibrahim Ag Alhabib and Alhassane Ag Touhami joined forces and started writing nostalgia-laced songs full of longing for the desert and the communal lifestyle it requires.\n\"We were entranced by that sound,\" Alhabib said in a conversation several years ago. \"We decided to use the money we'd saved to buy these instruments and incorporate those influences into our sound, which enamored the people of the camp. We've been together ever since.\"\nFor many centuries the Tuaregs were the masters of the Sahara who played a vital economic and cultural role linking west and north Africa. When the great empires of Mali arose in the 11th and 12th centuries, the Tuaregs, or Kel Tamashek as they call themselves, helped make Timbuktu a thriving university town, where some of the world's most advanced scholars wrote treatise on mathematics, physics, medicine and Sufi-inspired Islamic spirituality (scrolls targeted for destruction by the radical Islamic groups Ansar Dine and Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb).\nRelated to North Africa's indigenous Amazigh (or Berber) peoples, the Tuareg resisted French colonialism into the late 19th century, earning a reputation as fierce and cunning desert warriors. With the end of French colonial rule in the 1960s, Tuareg society found itself divided among the newly independent nations. The rebellion against Mali's military government in the early '90s dispersed the Tuareg further, leaving many exiled in refugee camps in Mauritania, Algeria and Burkino Faso.\nTinariwen's UC Theatre date is the only Bay Area stop on a tour following the release of a new CD, Elwan (Anti-), a searing album laced with anger and dismay at the ongoing chaos since radical Islamic insurgents took over northern Mali in 2012 and banned musical instruments and performances. Led by guitarist and vocalist Alhassane Ag Touhami, a founding member known as the Lion of the Desert for his role in the early 1990s Tuareg insurgency against Mali's government, the band's latest incarnation features a new generation of musicians.\n\n\"The responsibility is huge,\" said electric bassist Eyadou Ag Leche, speaking in French through an interpreter before a concert in San Francisco. \"Tinariwen today are like ambassadors of Tuaregs worldwide. Tuareg children watch them, know everything they do, where they've been, what they've played and what they've done.\n\"Ever since I was born I was aware of the implications of Tinariwen,\" he continues. \"I grew up with this music. As a kid I would follow them around. I played guitar and at a certain point the idea just came to me to start playing electric bass. When they started performing outside of Mali in 2001, they chose a few young Tuaregs who were involved in their music to work with them. That's how I started touring with them.\"\nRecommended: 'Space is the Place'\nPianist, keyboardist, bandleader, space traveler and intrepid Afrofuturist Sun Ra.

Sembene's 1966 feature Black Girl - the story of a Senegalese woman working as a Parisian maid - was one of the course highlights (the only other film I can remember seeing was Courage of the People, a brilliant, and now elusive, Bolivian feature about a tin-mining strike).\nThe Senegalese director is also one of the focal points of Pacific Film Archive's current series, African Film Festival 2017, and, though the widely available Black Girl isn't on the schedule PFA does have a special treat on tap: a rare screening of its archival print of Sembene's little-known 1968 feature Mandabi (The Money Order). Preceded by a 4 p.m. showing of the recent documentary Sembene!, Mandabi screens at 6 p.m. on Sunday, April 2.\nIn contrast to the European-set Black Girl, Mandabi takes place almost entirely in Senegal's capital city of Dakar, where the film's protagonist Ibrahim (Makhouredia Gueye), has two wives, a handful of children, and no income with which to support them. Nonetheless, the vain Ibrahim keeps up appearances by visiting the barber, where we see him getting his nostril hairs trimmed with a straight razor.\nWait, don't go away!\n\nThe arrival of a letter from his nephew, Abdou, is a surprise and a source of new hope for the beleaguered Ibrahim. Working as a street cleaner in Paris, Abdou has conscientiously saved 25,000 francs for the family, which he's sent to them in the form of a money order -- now Ibrahim will be able to pay back his accumulated debt and still have a little left over.\nThe money order, however, proves more curse than blessing. In order to cash it at the local post office, Ibrahim needs an ID card; in order to get an ID card, he needs a birth certificate; in order to get a birth certificate, he needs to know the date of his birth -- and then, of course, there's the matter of getting his picture taken.\nMandabi details its protagonist's Kafkaesque adventure and the widespread corruption and dishonesty he encounters and participates in. By the final reel, virtually everyone we've met has been implicated in one way or another - including Ibrahim's westernized nephew, Hamath, whose ability to circumvent bureaucratic roadblocks is matched by his willingness to pocket his uncle's money. Only the neighborhood's scrupulously honest mailman emerges with reputation intact.\nIt's impossible, of course, to know whether or not Sembene's cinematic pep talk had a beneficial effect on his fellow citizens, but today Senegal is considered one of the most democratic and least corrupt African nations, and ranks ahead of countries like Greece, India, and Turkey at the international level. Something's gone right in the tiny country, and I'm inclined to give this excellent little film - and its creator - some of the credit.\nFootnote: somewhat bizarrely, some of France's most notable pornographers worked on this film, including producer Robert de Nesle, cinematographer Paul Soulignac, and editor Gilbert Kikoine. Don't worry, though - there's nothing remotely prurient about Mandabi.\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "Big Screen Berkeley: 'Mandabi'", "Tags": "['Big Screen Berkeley', 'Movies']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'Movies']", "Natural Language Location": "BAMPFA", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8707845", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "252832", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2686016", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/29/big-screen-berkeley-mandabi/", "Author": "John Seal", "Date": "2017-03-29T06:00:29-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Jessma Evans as Nora and Kevin Kemp as Torvald in Nora by the Shotgun Players. Photo: Pak HanShotgun Players is always ready to try the off-beat or difficult play. It never insults its audience with the mundane or prosaic. So, one can see why Shotgun found Ingmar Bergman's 1981 stage version of Henrik Ibsen's immortal 1879 A Doll's House such an attractive production. And an attractive production it is. With Jessma Evans (Top Girls) excelling as Nora Helmer, and Kevin Kemp as her husband, Torvald, there is lots of life left in Ibsen's 138-year-old creation -- with a few tweaks by Bergman.\nIbsen's original script, in which the infantilized Nora finally awakens to her second-class status and walks out on her paternalistic, self-righteous husband and their children, was shocking to society when it was first produced, although now it is all too commonplace a domestic scene. Yet it can still be moving to observe Nora experiencing abandonment instead of adoration in her husband's attitude, as she becomes aware of the meaningless and artificiality of her life.\nBergman's script (translated and adapted by Frederick J. Marker and Lise-Lone Marker), does not dramatically alter A Doll's House. Rather, it eliminates several characters, including servants and children, and tones down some of the more archaic language and pet names Torvald called Nora in the original version. But it is still interspersed with stilted dialogue that caused occasional, inappropriate laughter by members of the audience.\nBergman moderated Torvald's archness by making him a bit more human, but Torvald still doesn't get Nora at all. Bergman said in 1981, I see [Torvald] Helmer as a very nice guy, very responsible. [The play] is really the tragedy of [Torvald] Helmer. Bergman may see Torvald's tragedy as his inability to treat his wife any differently than his society dictated. But to most audiences, the tragedy is Nora's. After all, Ibsen based his drama on the experiences of a woman he knew.\n\nL to r: Erin Mei-Ling Stuart as Mrs. Linde, Adam Elder as Krogstad, Kevin Kemp as Torvald, Jessma Evans as Nora and Michael J. Asberry as Dr. Rank in Nora. Photo: Pak HanBeth Wilmurt, a gifted actor on the Ashby Stage (Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?), seems more accomplished at directing than one might think, knowing Nora was only her second turn at bat. She has concentrated on adding more action to the drama, and even included a suggestive sexual interlude between the Helmers.\nHowever, at times the staging of Nora seemed to get in the way of the acting. Without any servants, Torvald's faithful companion, Dr. Rank (Michael J. Asberry), Nora's childhood friend, Mrs. Kristine Linde (Erin Mei-Ling Stuart) and the blackmailer, Nils Krogstad (Adam Elder) wander on and off the stage, appearing inside the Helmer house as if by magic. This problem is exacerbated by the Ashby Stage's high platform/stage, which has no steps to aid entrances and exits. And perhaps there is deep meaning that I missed in why Nora pushed the heavy sofa on to the stage at the start of the play and a table and chairs later on, and why the well-chosen wallpapered backdrop moved forward and backwards during the performance.\nBergman didn't omit any of the key elements of A Doll's House, and his starker version focuses the drama. But the play is still dated, although not old enough to be appreciated as a timeless tragedy. Nevertheless, it's an interesting production, presenting a fine opportunity to see Ingmar Bergman's homage to Henrik Ibsen's masterpiece.\nNora is playing at the Ashby Stage through April 23, 2017.

The building was designed by Walter Ratcliff and built built as a public garage with a showroom in 1923 for Cochran McCarron. By 1930 McCarron had moved to University Avenue and a branch dealership of the H.O. Harrison Company occupied the Shattuck Avenue space, selling Hudson and Essex automobiles.  By the 1960s, perhaps as early as 1954, the building was occupied by British Motor Distributors, run by Kjell Qvale. He was the first distributor of the Jaguar on the West Coast.

When Sather Gate was finished in 1910, mounted on the gate's columns were eight marble bas relief panels sculpted by Melvin Earl Cumming, an instructor in modeling in the university's School of Architecture. The panels depicted male and female nudes representing the eight fields of learning: letters, mining, medicine, law, electricity, agriculture, architecture and art. Nudes in 1910! Not long though. After originally supporting the panels and bridling at talk of removing them, Mrs. Sather saw embarrassed students and reacted - the panels were \"extremely indecent\" and \"disgusting.\" The relief panels were removed.\nThey were stored under the bleachers at Edwards Stadium and at the Amador Marble Company in Oakland. Discovered in 1977, they were reinstalled in 1979. In a 2008 article in SFGATE that Daniella Thompson forwarded me, Ken Stein wrote that the men were originally facing south, but that juxtaposition of the plaque reading \"Erected By Jane K.

Photo: Thomas DornIn the world of Brazilian culture Vinicius de Moraes occupied a singular, expansive niche. Even when he was serving his country as a diplomat, he produced a sublime stream of words as a playwright, poet, essayist, and lyricist whose collaboration with composer Antonio Carlos Jobim made him the poet laureate of bossa nova. When guitarist/composer Vinicius Cantuaria established himself as an essential new voice on the Brazilian scene -- particularly with his monster hit \"Lua e Estrela\" -- Jobim welcomed him into the fold as a rightful bearer of an august name.\n\"I had beautiful communication with Jobim,\" said Cantuaria, who performs a tribute to Jobim Wednesday at Freight & Salvage, on a recent Skype conversation from his home in Rio de Janeiro. \"There was the old Vinicius, and he called me the new Vinicius. We always had a good time. He was the first to say you should move to the U.S.\"\nLike just about every songwriter who grew up hearing Jobim's exquisite body of tunes, Cantuaria owes a tremendous creative debt to the maestro, a balance he acknowledged directly with his gorgeous 2015 album Vinicius Canta Antonio Carlos Jobim (Sunnyside). For Wednesday's performance, he'll be performing solo, accompanying himself on guitar and focusing on Jobim masterpieces, both well known and obscure.\n\"For me his music is so beautiful and sounds like Brazil,\" Cantuaria said. \"He was the first guy who really focused on saving the earth. He was talking about saving the environment in the 60s. His music is a fusion of all the Brazilian music from the 1930s and 40s, and the first Brazilian romance with jazz. It's so rich. I grew up with this music and it's so wonderful to play and sing Jobim. It's not easy.\"\n\n\nWhere Jobim captured Brazil's sights, sounds and ecology from his perch in Rio's lush Jardim Botanico neighborhood, Cantuaria fully came into his musical identity only by leaving his homeland. Relocating to Brooklyn in 1994 made him feel more deeply Brazilian than he ever felt in Rio de Janeiro (he moved back to Rio two years ago).\nThe release of his first U.S. album in 1996, Sol Na Cara (Gramavision), which was produced by guitarist Arto Lindsay and features arrangements by Ryuichi Sakamoto, captured the creative ferment Cantuaria experienced soaking in New York City's overflowing pool of talent, collaborating with artists such as David Byrne, Laurie Anderson, Brian Eno, guitarist Bill Frisell, pianist Brad Mehldau, and violinist Jenny Scheinman. It's as if he created a Brazilian island of his own in New York, and invited a disparate crew of creative castaways to join him.\nPart of the problem for Cantuaria was that in Brazil he had become a known quantity enmeshed in the country's huge music industry. He first gained attention in the mid 1970s as the founder of the rock band O Terco, but his career really took off a few years later when Caetano Veloso hired him as the drummer for his controversial new group A Outra Banda Da Terra.\nWhile at first denounced by critics, the band recorded a series of popular albums, including Veloso's first million sellers, 1981's Outras palavras and 1982's Cores, Nomes. It was Cantuaria who wrote the 1981 hit \"Lua e Estrela\" (Moon and Star), the song that transformed Veloso from a revered musical visionary into a genuine pop star.\n\"When I wrote 'Lua,' I never could imagine that kind of success,\" Cantuaria said in an interview several years ago, when he was still living in Brooklyn. \"It changed my life, but not my way of doing the music. More people knew me, I had more opportunities to show things to people. But in Brazil when I tried to do something new it was so difficult.

It's difficult when you're part of the game.\"\nWhile he continued to write hits for Brazilian artists, Cantuaria found a measure of creative freedom in the U.S. the eluded him at home. Over the past two decades he's released a series of gorgeous albums, though he has never surpassed the sublime lyricism of 1999's Tucuma (Verve), a session that pairs his poetic Portuguese lyrics and ringing acoustic guitar chords with Erik Friedlander's translucent cello, Peter Apfelbaum's brawny tenor saxophone and Joey Baron's delicate drums.\nHe gained a whole new audience through his work with guitarist Bill Frisell's stylistically polyglot ensemble The Intercontinentals, which also featured Malian percussionist Sidiki Camara, Greek-born Christos Govetas on oud and bouzouki, string wizard Greg Leisz, and violinist Jenny Scheinman. Besides their work together in Frisell's band, Scheinman has toured widely with Cantuaria, soloing brilliantly throughout his two-disc album on Kufula, Live: Skirball Cultural center 8/7/03.\n\"His music is unknowable and totally accessible all at the same time,\" Scheinman said. \"I don't know how those Brazilians do it. They manage to make all this lushness and complexity sound like pop music, and he's the real master of that. On tour we'd be playing these tunes that I could barely transcribe and the whole audience would be singing along.\"\nIf there's an element of mystery in Cantuaria's music, perhaps it stems from his passion for Miles Davis, a primary source of inspiration along with pianist Bill Evans, trumpeter/vocalist Chet Baker, and of course Jobim, with whom he's just getting started when it comes to recording.\n\"I want to do volumes two, three and four singing and playing Jobim,\" Cantuaria said. \"My list has a hundred songs, and I just selected them at random for the album. For the next one I'll do the same thing.\"\nRecommended gigs: Rent Romus / Bows\nRent Romus.

On the surface,  it seems an apt comparison: neither Leonard nor Bob could be accused of possessing a great singing voice, and each chose to write literate, elliptical, and deeply personal songs that both invite and defy interpretation.\nDylan, however, was a pop star by the time he was in his early twenties, while the unambitious, lugubrious Cohen wouldn't achieve fame until attaining middle-age. While Bob always seemed to belong to the counterculture, Leonard came from the more traditional worlds of prose and poetry: Bob sang about a leopard-skin pillbox hat; Leonard looked comfortable in a tweed jacket.\nCohen's discomfort with his role as popular musician is all too clear in Bird on a Wire, a concert film that's taken over 40 years to reach its intended home on the big screen. Opening at San Francisco's Roxie Theater on Friday, March 24 (no East Bay play dates are currently scheduled), the film follows the reluctant Cohen on a 20-date international tour designed to give his then flagging recording career a boost.\nDirected by documentarian Tony Palmer (All You Need Is Love), Bird on a Wire remained incomplete from the time it was shot until 2010. Cohen retained possession of the film for decades, his intention to finish it eventually ending in 2009 when he returned it to Palmer, who completed the editing process and released the film on DVD.\n\nThe film begins with something you generally don't associate with a Leonard Cohen gig: a fistfight between overzealous, orange-clad security guards and members of the audience. This bizarre, disquieting vision echoes the Maysles Brothers' Gimme Shelter but happily ended sans fatalities, as Cohen's interjection \"there's no point in starting a war right now\" proved considerably more effective than Jagger's \"just be cool down there in the front\".\nPalmer uses complete performances of such Cohen standards as \"Avalanche,\" \"So Long Marianne,\" \"Suzanne,\" \"Who by Fire,\" and the titular song, and while some are less than brilliant others are pure magic. In addition, there's a wealth of fascinating backstage footage: see Leonard trying to pick up women! See women trying to pick-up Leonard! See Leonard go off on his road crew for failing to keep the PA in good working order (except in Glasgow)! See Leonard almost breakdown after what he perceived to be a poor performance!\nIn sum, Cohen was a poet passing as a rock star, and a self-deprecating one at that. \"Anything that is popular\", he says (describing himself), \"is often not really good\", and when asked \"what do you like to talk about?\" he answers \"I prefer not to speak at all.\" A man after my own heart.\n'My Love Affair with the Brain'\nMarian Diamond and a friendThere's not much I can add to Kate Darby Rauch's recent and very thorough Berkeleyside article about the venerable Marian Diamond, but I feel I'd be remiss not to mention this week's KQED airings of My Love Affair with the Brain.

Photo: Robert Day\"It's more akin to seeing a gig, than it is to seeing a regular piece of theater,\" explained Ferdy Roberts, associate director of Filter Theatre, which opens its production of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night on Wednesday as part of Cal Performances. \"Expect a bit of rock & roll.\"\nRoberts and his co-founder, Oliver Dimsdale, explained Filter's approach at the Page & Stage \"book club\" on Monday night at The Musical Offering Cafe Bistro. Dimsdale and Roberts founded Filter when they were students at London's Guildhall School of Music & Drama in the '90s. As theater students, they did a lot of socializing with musicians, but had no academic interaction with them.\n\"We wanted to bring acting and music together,\" Roberts explained. \"We're more like a band works than a traditional theater company.\"\n\"Traditional\" actually is a loaded work for the Filter founders. In their view, some of what their group does harks back to an older theater tradition, one that might have been familiar in Elizabethan England, but it seems Filter is stuck with the label of \"experimental theater.\"\n\nMany of Filter's productions involve devising new works. Their first production, Faster, took science writer James Gleick's book of the same title about the acceleration of modern life and became a hit at London's Battersea Arts Centre. Filter worked the same alchemy with Water, which explored global warming, and with Silence, which explored urban noise. But Filter has also tackled classic works of theater by Brecht, Chekhov and Shakespeare.\nThe Twelfth Night that opens at Zellerbach Playhouse on Wednesday resulted from a collaboration with two icons of \"traditional\" theater. First, Filter were workshopping some ideas at the National Theatre in London and then-NT artistic director Nicholas Hytner encouraged them to work on two plays, Twelfth Night and Chekhov's Three Sisters. Then Filter were commissioned in 2006 by the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) to take part in a festival of Shakespeare's complete works. The commission came with a catch: the budget meant that Filter could only use six actors and two musicians. Twelfth Night has 15 characters.\nWorking with director Sean Holmes, Filter figured out ways to double up some of the roles and made some abridgments to the original text (about a quarter of the play is edited out). The co-founders are both key actors in the company. Roberts plays Malvolio - \"you'll see me humiliated, I mean really humiliated\" - and Dimsdale plays Sir Toby Belch - \"Belch is really an alcoholic, and there's nothing funny about an alcoholic.\"\nRoberts said Filter were fortunate in their timing when they started on their \"response to Twelfth Night,\" because Holmes had just finished a stint directing at the RSC. According to Roberts, Holmes \"felt straitjacketed by all that money\" in a main stage RSC production.\nBy contrast, Filter is eager to try new things. Roberts said it demonstrates the different attitude of musicians compared to theater folk.\n\"Their approach is, 'Why not?'\" he said.\nDimsdale said Filter's approach marks a strong contrast to the director-led style that dominates UK theater.\n\"You allow yourself in the midst of rehearsal to make discoveries,\" he said. \"At the end, you have something of a journey that everyone has come through.\"\nAnd how does the Filter approach manifest in Twelfth Night?\n\"Our production has a lot of heart,\" Dimsdale said, \"and it has a lot of tomfoolery and silliness as well.\"\n\"Over the years, we have had quite a few people stand up and say, 'How dare you do this to Shakespeare?'\" Roberts said. \"We'd rather have an audience that is divided - love it and hate it - than have people say, 'Oh, that was nice. Where should we go for dinner?'\"\nTwelfth Night is at the Zellerbach Playhouse Wednesday through Friday, March 22-24, 8 p.m., Saturday, March 25, 2 p.m. and 8 p.m., and Sunday, March 26, 3 p.m. Tickets are available from Cal Performances. \n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "Filter Theatre's 'Twelfth Night': more of a gig than a regular piece of theater", "Tags": "['Arts', 'Cal Performances', 'Theater in Berkeley', 'UC Berkeley', 'Zellerbach Hall']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'UC Berkeley']", "Natural Language Location": "Zellerbach Hall", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8690669", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "252184", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2630208", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/21/filter-theatres-twelfth-night-gig-regular-piece-theater/", "Author": "Lance Knobel", "Date": "2017-03-21T14:00:43-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Beneath the Tall Tree, the latest production of TheatreFIRST. Photo: TheatreFIRSTAt a rehearsal less than two weeks before Beneath the Tall Tree opened at TheatreFIRST, a theater company that leases and operates Live Oak Theater in North Berkeley, Joy Carlin, the director, and Adrienne Walters, the playwright, were deep in discussion about a how a new speech would fit into the story arc.\nWalters had just written the speech the night before and it was meant to reflect a central question of the play: what it is like to be ambiguously biracial. Walters, who modeled the main character on herself, said she wrote the speech to express the character's \"lack of identity.\"\n\"She isn't Japanese, but she's not, like, white,\" Walters said. \"I don't identify with either, which is how a lot of hapas feel.\" (Hapa comes from Hawaiian and designates someone of mixed ancestry or half-Asian.)\nCarlin agreed to give the speech a try in rehearsal that night, and she ultimately decided to keep it in. It is one of many revelatory moments in \"Beneath the Tall Tree,\" the story of a Japanese-American teenager who buries his family's heirloom, a samurai sword, before the family is interned during World War II. After the war, he goes to look for the sword but cannot remember where it is buried. Two generations later, his granddaughter, who is training as an archaeologist, decides to search for the sword -- and a lost cultural identity -- after her grandfather's death. The play runs through March 25.\n\nThe last-minute changes to the script, as well as the community and culture represented in Beneath the Tall Tree, reflect the mission of TheatreFIRST, which sees itself as a development company bringing underrepresented points of view to the stage. The company also works hard to diversify its audience and its leadership.\n\"TheatreFIRST creates a social hub where, through the art of storytelling, all voices get heard,\" according to the company's website. \"Dedicated to telling the world's stories through multiple, simultaneous viewpoints, TheatreFIRST has redeveloped its lens so that a more actual world will be reflected and a more actual world will attend.\"\nTo do this, TheatreFIRST helps foster \"new, necessary stories,\" by bringing aspiring and accomplished playwrights into \"collaborative residencies,\" according to the group's mission statement. The plays produced in the workshops then go on to be presented to audiences the next season.\n\"How do you put the artists at the center of their own stories?\" said Jon Tracy, a well-regarded Bay Area director who took the helm as TheatreFIRST's artistic director a year ago. \"What is it to build work from the ground up, from the origins of the artists that should be telling the story and have not had the chance to tell these stories?\"\nJon Tracy took over as artistic director of TheatreFIRST in March 2015. Photo: Mary ReesOne Tracy's first steps when he came to TheatreFIRST was to expand the board of directors, as a system of checks and balances on himself, a white man, and to reflect more accurately the population of Berkeley and the society they serve, he said. In practical terms, this means that at least fifty percent of the advisory board, staff, casts and creative teams are female-identified and two-thirds are people of color. Tracy said his board is filled with \"business-minded creatives\" who can build \"sustainable projects,\" rather than the traditional arts patrons with deep pockets.\nMaking changes didn't stop there, however.\n\"There are no answers; there are only better questions,\" Tracy said. \"What does it mean to say, 'fifty-percent female-identified,' where a lot of our artists identify somewhere on the spectrum?\" he asked. \"We wouldn't have been able to get to that question if we hadn't asked the first.\"\nTheatreFIRST has the lease to the Live Oak Theatre on Shattuck Avenue. The entrance to the theater. Photo: Mary ReesTheatreFIRST has also inspired some alterations to the theater itself. There's no more boxy snack bar in the lobby. The exterior wall on the Live Oak Park side of the lobby will be removed and rebuilt several feet further out, making way for an ADA-compliant bathroom near the theater entrance, according to Tracy. Several rows of seats were removed from the theater so that the front of the stage could be extended forward for the current play.\nBeneath the Tall Tree is the third of four new works offered by TheatreFIRST this season. Director Carlin, who in 1971 was the first woman to direct a play on the Geary stage of the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, said she hopes other theatre companies will perform the play\n\"It's instructional; it's theatrical, it's dramatic -- it's a good play; I would hope people pick it up, but you never know,\" Carlin said.\nShe said that the audience at Live Oak Theater is far younger than at most of the theaters she has worked in. \"I think that's good because so many of them really don't know about the (Japanese) relocation at all, so it could be news to them,\" Carlin said, \"and they'll find out a lot about it in this play.\"\nBesides developing new stories for the stage, TheatreFIRST aims to invite and build a more diverse theatre-going audience. Tracy said that takes \"getting humble\" and \"listening to other people's stories.\" It means \"really exploring the word 'outreach,' what it is physically, but much more emotionally and socially, going to their door, to their space, acting as a guest, not a colonizer, and listening,\" Tracy said.\nThe next season for TheatreFIRST is already under discussion. \"We're looking at how each one of the plays that we do has a continuation factor,\" Tracy said. For example, one play under consideration for 2017-18 deals with redress for the interned Japanese and their descendants.\nBeneath the Tall Tree, written by Walters and Jeffrey Lo, with dramaturgy by Oona Hatton, and direction by Carlin, plays through Saturday, March 25, at Live Oak Theatre, 1301 Shattuck Ave. Tickets cost $20 to $25.\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "At TheatreFIRST, playwriting is driven by innovation and inclusion", "Tags": "['Jon Tracy', 'Joy Carlin', 'TheatreFirst']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'Theater']", "Natural Language Location": "Live Oak Theater", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8838924", "Zip Code": "94709", "ID": "252139", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2691846", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/21/berkeleys-theatrefirst-playwriting-driven-innovation-inclusion/", "Author": "Mary Rees", "Date": "2017-03-21T11:00:51-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Josh Kornbluth in his new film Love and Taxes\"I'm a mess,\" says Josh Kornbluth in \"Citizen Josh,\" a self-deprecating one-man show that emerged from his disappointment about the 2004 election that kept George W. Bush in office. In 2007, that piece had a run at Berkeley Rep, and Kornbluth resurrected it last month at the Berkeley Fellowship of Unitarian Universalists as a benefit for Indivisible Berkeley.\nIn his first movie, Haiku Tunnel, which was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 2001 and directed by his brother, Jacob, a character named Josh Kornbluth (played by Josh Kornbluth) can't motivate himself to do what his boss has requested, which is simply to mail 85 very important letters. The protagonist spends the rest of the film trying to cover up what he has done (or rather, not done), as he wrestles with self-loathing, overshares, and sinks further and further into a swamp of his own making.\nWhere to see Josh Kornbluth & 'Love and Taxes': Love and Taxes made its debut at the Rialto Elmwood Theater on Friday March 17. The Kornbluth brothers will do a Q&A session after the 7 p.m show tonight, Monday. For other local appearances, check online. On Wednesday, March 29, at 7:30 p.m., see Kornbluth at the Marsh in San Francisco. He'll perform \"Brain Improvs,\" a solo show based on his experiences as an artist-in-residence and volunteer at the Zen Hospice Project in San Francisco.In Love and Taxes, his newest movie (also directed by Jacob), Kornbluth again puts the spotlight on neuroses and failures as his character confronts the enormous tax problem he has created by refusing to pay taxes for seven years. The crisis entangles his personal life because his pregnant girlfriend, Sara, insists that he clean up the mess before they marry so that she, too, won't become legally embroiled in his problems. As if there weren't enough challenges, Kornbluth's character has (like the real Kornbluth) been raised to hate \"the man\" and \"the system,\" so meeting his civic duties seems like another kind of failure.\nOne option is to declare bankruptcy, and the idea grows on him because it reeks of failure: \"When you think about it, me and bankruptcy -- that's like a match made in heaven. I'm surprised no one came up with it before.\"\n\nIt's imperative to him to stay with Sara. He fell in love the moment he realized that when she drives, she feels incapable of taking left turns, so she keeps taking rights. Kornbluth's character joyfully says, \"Clearly she's neurotic. But her neuroses seem to be different from my neuroses. Perhaps we even have complementary neuroses!\"\nJust as his inert characters are far from being typical heroes, Kornbluth himself has none of the physical features of classic leading men. At 57, he looks more like a squishy Ben Franklin than Brad Pitt. In fact, when Kornbluth spotted this resemblance in a steamy bathroom mirror while shaving, he felt compelled to create a show about Ben Franklin, despite knowing nothing about the man at the time. After pitching the half-baked idea to two big-shots, Kornbluth pulled it off, and \"Ben Franklin: Unplugged\" opened in 1998. He resurrected it at the Z Space Studio in Fort Mason in 2004 to enthusiastic reviews.\n\"I've done a lot of basements\"\nKornbluth hasn't always performed in impressive arenas. \"I've done a lot of basements,\" says the self-described monologuist, who grew up in Manhattan and has lived in Berkeley for 20 years. As a performer, he cut his teeth on comedy gigs at La Val's Subterranean Theatre in the basement of La Val's Pizza on Euclid Avenue, regularly having his monologues interrupted as the staff shouted \"24!\" to indicate that an order was ready. He was paid in pizzas and wonders if there's a correlation between that form of currency and the cholesterol problem he now treats with medication.\nIf his career has sometimes lacked prestige, his talents haven't escaped the notice of locals, who regularly fill the seats at indie venues in San Francisco to see him perform. (His wife Sara was one of his fans, as Love and Taxes shows.) Audiences have been key because Kornbluth develops all his material by doing improvisation and seeing how audiences respond. That was the genesis of Haiku Tunnel, which was filmed in San Francisco.\nFrom 2005 to 2007, he was also a local television luminary, hosting \"The Josh Kornbluth Show\" on KQED. In that capacity he interviewed actors Alan Alda and Helen Mirren, Senator Barbara Boxer, photographer Annie Leibowitz, and conductor Michael Tilson Thomas, among others.\nWith Love and Taxes, Kornbluth reaches a new level of success in that he convinced former U.S. labor secretary Robert Reich to take a small role. The crazy idea to include Reich in the movie \"was just instinctual,\" says Kornbluth. As it turns out, Reich loves to act, and filmmaker Jacob Kornbluth (Josh's brother) has made multiple movies involving Reich. \"He's so wonderful on economics and equality and inequality and social justice,\" says Josh of Reich. \"I felt that the message of the film would resonate with him.\"\nThey shot Reich's scene at The Marsh Berkeley Arts Center, though Reich is supposed to be in a fancy law firm in Washington, D.C. He plays Sheldon S. Cohen, the former commissioner of the IRS.\nBefore the scene, Sara (who teaches in East Bay public schools) hastily did Reich's makeup and tamed his unruly hair with a comb. She and Josh now keep that comb in a jar in their bathroom. A label on the jar says, \"This comb was used by Robert Reich.\"\nIn Love and Taxes, Robert Reich plays Sheldon S. Cohen, the former commissioner of the IRSNotes on failure\nDespite these achievements, Kornbluth puts on no airs. Noting that he's \"not a person who has done great things,\" he acknowledges that it takes chutzpah to invite people to a theater to hear him talk exclusively about himself. He doesn't just do light riffs, either. Instead, he stands before audiences and rolls out his greatest failures, his most cringeworthy moments, and the very depths of his fractured psyche.\nIn \"Citizen Josh\" he says, \"I've noticed something. People persist at things and they succeed. What's up with that?\" At another point in that show, he announces, \"I can't even fold my socks.\"\nAlthough some might brag about having attended Princeton, Kornbluth has created two shows to focus on what didn't work out for him there. He flunked calculus (the subject of the solo theater piece \"The Mathematics of Change\"), and left without a diploma after failing to write the required thesis. \"Citizen Josh\" depicts his efforts to secure a diploma 25 years later by tackling a thesis -- only to meet with failure.\nAll these plots match his life. Actually, he's still working on that thesis, only now it's been 35 years.\nA sleight of hand\nIn reviewing \"The Mathematics of Change,\" the New York Times referred to Kornbluth's act as \"pained self-examination.\" But is his auto-flagellation truly as excruciating for Kornbluth as one might imagine?\nIt's important not to mix up the two Josh Kornbluths. The real one speaks with a deep, strong voice, whereas the invented Kornbluth persona is a schlemiel whose voice tends to be high and constricted for comedic effect. The real Kornbluth loves wrestling with complex questions, whereas the schlemiel version is constantly surprised by the world's realities. The Love and Taxes character is under the impression that someone is giving him tax advice for free, only to discover later on that she's been running the meter since he walked in her door and that he now owes her a staggering $15,000.\nJosh Kornbluth in schlemiel mode as he consults with an intimidating tax expert in Love and TaxesActor Josh Kornbluth is very clear that he is not the Josh Kornbluth persona: \"I feel like when I'm performing, I'm a character. I happen to use Josh Kornbluth as my character.\" He adds with a chortle, \"That just happens to be the character that I can play.\"\nTo be sure, the schlemiel characters are based on the actual Kornbluth and his failings. \"I really have so much evidence in my life for being disorganized and out of control,\" he says. \"Those things really happened to me.\"\nNevertheless, he notes, \"In doing my part in telling the story, if I'm doing it at all successfully, I can't be absolutely disorganized because I wrote, co-produced, and starred in this movie that was really hard to make! It's really hard to make an independent film. The saving grace for me is that even though I am so disorganized and neurotic, I'm able to tell stories about it. And when you tell stories, you have gained a measure of control over that chaos.\"\nAs he notes, when the on-screen Kornbluth tells you he's a fuck-up, he's entertaining you, so he has succeeded, and the whole set-up is a deft \"sleight of hand.\" You've paid to see him, and as the storyteller, he's holding the reins. He's a lot more in control than audiences might realize. \"I feel like a winner because, the fact that I'm in a theater telling stories -- that's a win,\" says Kornbluth, laughing.\nHe delights in subverting expectations. With the title Love and Taxes, he took the phrase \"death and taxes\" and \"turned it on its head. That was very appealing to me,\" he says.\nRead Berkeleyside film critic John Seal's review of Love and Taxes.He also surprises his audiences by choosing dull-sounding topics and showing how emotional they are at base. For instance, he has observed that math elicits dread. \"Dread is really good for stories,\" he observes.\nSaying that taxes represent \"the exaction of money that you perhaps thought you possessed,\" he says he has learned that taxes are also an unexpectedly intense and upsetting topic for people. After all, \"The authorities that enforce the tax laws can seem very implacable.\"\n\"I tend to be intuitive about what will work,\" he says in regard to the subjects he chooses for shows, such as death and dementia.\nWith the failure theme, Kornbluth aligns himself with the long list of comedians who have portrayed themselves as screw-ups. For example, Woody Allen, invented this \"nearsighted, schleppy Jewish guy who was also weirdly aggressive.\"\nAside from Allen, Kornbluth's comedic heroes include Mel Brooks, Spalding Gray, Carl Reiner, Richard Pryor, and Oliver Platt. He also reveres Pete Seeger.\nIdentifying closely and proudly with his own Jewishness, Kornbluth is particularly aware of the Jewish comedians who performed in the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York starting in the 1920s: \"I feel like I have a lot of the Catskills in me.\"\nJosh Kornbluth in Love and TaxesThe border between pain and humor\nDespite all the control Kornbluth professes to have as the entertainer, he hardly has solid self-esteem. For a while during childhood, he thought he was the \"bee's knees\" because he was a top-notch student. But, he notes, his view of himself has \"always been mixed. Certainly now I feel there are many ways in which I feel I'm a real fuck-up. I don't know how many of us are heroes to ourselves.\"\nHe hit a particularly low spot in his mid-20s: \"My father had died a couple of years before, and I'd been searching for what to do with my life and as a career. At the time I was a copyeditor, and I was trying to be a writer, but I never met deadlines, and I didn't like writing. And I was just kind of floating because I was mourning. I was unmoored.\"\nDuring that period, he says, \"I felt like such a fuck-up. I fucked up so much. Not going in to work or going to work late. I quit my job, but I would have lost it.\" He lived in a closet at MIT and used the shower at the animal research lab.\nFor those with a shaky sense of self-worth, performing for audiences and making them focus on one's weaknesses might seem like torture, but Kornbluth revels in doing just that. He finds it liberating, and he recognizes how unusual this is: \"It's literally the last place you would expect someone to open up about their thoughts, hopes, and fears, and I have a compulsion to do it. It releases me.\"\nBeing in front of an audience makes his ideas flow in a way that can't happen when he's alone with his computer and the delete key. On stage, as he develops material, he refuses to censor himself for fear of leaving out something that belongs in the show. He frequently tells audiences stories that he's never told his closest friends or relatives.\n\"I'm following the energy that is going on between me and the audience. And that's what inspires me to create the stories. And then I over-create,\" he says, noting that he later collaborates with people to edit out whatever isn't landing.\nWith such a set-up, there's little to prevent him from telling too much about himself. That's an enormous danger of the form, he notes, particularly because success in his genre requires him to go to an uncomfortable place. There are definitely times when he has taken it too far: \"I've overshared and then I feel bad about it for a few reasons. Sometimes it makes it yucky for the audience. The other part is that I feel like I've exposed myself in some unpleasant way. The stuff that works is at the edge of that. It's just before oversharing. And the edited result is something that I hope doesn't make the audience uncomfortable in a bad way. I hope I'm comfortable telling it, as well.\"\nAnother edge that Kornbluth finds crucial is the border between pain and humor. When it comes to that, he takes his cue from the late comedian Richard Pryor, who (as Kornbluth explains) talked about extremely heavy, difficult stuff while making it incredibly funny. \"Richard Pryor said the place he was going for in his comedy was the place where tragedy just was able to go over the edge into comedy. So close that it's right on the edge of the pain.\"\n\"I don't even primarily want people to like me\"\nKornbluth isn't after a laugh a minute from the audience, but he hates when they don't laugh at all: \"My goals are very serious,\" he says, adding that he wants people to experience his work as both funny and serious, both entertaining and cathartic.\nIn doing improv, he says, \"I don't even primarily want people to like me or to feel that they've been told a great yarn. What I'm aiming for is, what I'm prospecting for, is what is the spine of the piece? What is the real impulse behind my trying to tell this story? I'm looking for that more than anything else.\" He feels he never knows that at the outset.\nHe asks himself, \"What is the deep thing in this subject that connects me to audiences?\" And he looks for the part in a show where both he and the audience are intensely tuned in to something. \"My relationship with audiences is such a beautiful and profound thing,\" he says. \"Sometimes an audience's energy will pull me to a place I wouldn't have gone.\"\nHis brother Jacob says, \"I have always admired that, as theatrical monologues, Josh's stories possess the wonderful combination of being intensely personal to him and deeply relatable to others at the same time.\"\nJosh solicits audience feedback after a show, and people let him know which story really hit them. Having heard about his most embarrassing moments and failures, they often share just as openly about their lives. A woman recently wrote to him about a comically unsettling gynecological exam she had undergone. Kornbluth isn't fazed by hearing such things. \"People share a lot of stuff with me, and I appreciate it. I can take it.\"\nBecause his creative process depends on interplay with a live audience, Kornbluth finds it extremely challenging to turn his shows into movies. \"I want the film to have the same immediacy as the show,\" he explains. Early in the process of making \"Love and Taxes, Josh and Jacob (the director) realized that the film was falling short in that respect: \"There was kind of a pane of glass. There was a distance, like an unwelcome buffer zone that kept the movie from reaching people.\"\nThe solution was to mix in real footage of performances of the live show. As Josh explains, his persona in \"Love and Taxes\" is quite passive, and the story is about his inaction as he shirks responsibilities. The most dynamic thing going on is the neurosis and tension within the character. That works on stage but somehow didn't provide enough drama to carry the movie.\nBy contrast, the live footage crackles with energy because, Josh feels, he is at his best in that role: \"I am a monologuist. The kind of animal I am is a live performer. And when you see me performing in front of an audience, you're seeing more of the full me.\"\nJacob Kornbluth (left) lives in Berkeley, where he works as a screenwriter and director. Currently, he is co-director, with Robert Reich (center), of The Economic Inequality Media Project, a nonprofit that makes short videos to explain economic issues in understandable ways. Photo: Mark AltenbergAside from his desire to connect with audiences around deep truths, Kornbluth is driven by strong feelings about his father: \"If my dad hadn't died, I'm certain I wouldn't have become a performer. I want some way to keep his memory alive.\" His dad shaped Josh on every level: \"He communicated this vision of how the world could be, and how beautiful the world already was, in some magical secret way.\"\nKornbluth has made multiple pieces about his dad, including the 2004 piece \"Red Diaper Baby,\" which showed what it was like to grow up as with Communist parents. Josh's father would rouse Josh in the morning by singing The Internationale, the international Communist anthem.\nLove and Taxes is again about Kornbluth's father and about Josh's gradually relinquishing the role of being that godlike person's child and growing into his own adult self as a husband, father, and taxpaying citizen.\nLove and Taxes flashes back to Josh as a child with his father in ManhattanAbove all, Kornbluth wants to tell a story well and authentically. And that doesn't mean adhering to what actually happened in life.\nIn recent years, he has taught autobiographical storytelling at Stanford, and he implores his students, \"Please don't try to tell the literal, factual truth because the emotional truth is what's important.\"\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "Josh Kornbluth and the art of self-deprecation", "Tags": "['Movies']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts']", "Natural Language Location": "Rialto Cinemas Elmwood", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8566908", "Zip Code": "94705", "ID": "252058", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2531368", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/20/josh-kornbluth-art-self-deprecation/", "Author": "Eve Kushner", "Date": "2017-03-20T14:38:33-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Leni Riefenstahl (Stacy Ross) ponders her relationship with Hitler in Aurora Theatre Company's Leni. Photo: David AllenLeni, a powerful two-person high-wire act, examines the controversial Leni Riefenstahl (1902-2003), the 1930s extraordinary filmmaker and vilified Hitler propagandist. Leni is part exposition, part cross-examination and part psychoanalysis. This 80-minute (no intermission) production explores, but of course, cannot resolve, the persistent indictments of Nazi collaboration that have quashed Riefenstahl's reputation for more than 80 years.\nLeni Riefenstahl left her dancing and acting career to become a filmmaker who documented Hitler's triumphant rise to power. Her wordless film, Triumph of the Will, made in 1934 at the Nazi party rally in Nuremburg, was greatly praised for its innovative artistic techniques. It won many awards, including a gold medal at the 1935 Venice Biennale and the Grand Prix at the 1937 World Exhibition in Paris. Whether or not intended by Riefenstahl, and this is the crux of the matter, Triumph of Will became a prime propaganda vehicle for Hitler that helped bring millions of Germans to the Nazi cause.\nAs a method of analyzing Leni Riefenstahl's motivations and rationales, playwright Sarah Greenman introduces the audience to Riefenstahl just after her death at 101, as she directs a film of her life, which is acted by a younger version of herself. The two phases of Riefenstahl's lifespan are personified by marvelous actors -- the incomparable Stacy Ross (Gidion's Knot, Wilder Times) plays a commanding yet equivocal elderly Leni, while talented Martha Brigham (The How and The Why) acts a much younger, seductive Leni. The two women thrust accusations and parry retorts about Riefenstahl's life.\nIn the drama, Leni's defense to propagandizing is that she was an artist who only focused on her art and created the best film possible that documented a point in time, and that she bears no responsibility for how the film was used or what effect it had. This position is contradicted a number of times in the play as the audience sees her socializing with an unseen Hitler, cozying up to him for funding, as she denies allegations of a more intimate relationship. Among other charges, she chose to remain in Germany after all of her artist friends had left, and was said to have asked Hitler for extras in a film and was sent concentration camp victims. Leni is portrayed as commanding and self-obsessed. One could almost imagine that her narcissism might have allowed herself to see no further than her own art and ambition.\n\nYet despite the damning evidence, Riefenstahl was a creative talent who initiated what are now standard techniques in filmmaking, such as using multiple cameras, cranes and tracking rails. She also introduced the use of creative camera angles to film the human body in ways that are now commonplace in films, photography and commercials.\nThe performances in Leni necessarily become agitated at times as the indictments and rebuttals fly. Yet skilled director Jon Tracy (The Elaborate Entrance of Chad Deity, Breakfast With Mugabe) keeps the pace tense, but prevents it from growing frantic. Two movie screens show us clips of Riefenstahl's footage so we may judge her art for ourselves.\nDespite the stunning performances, if there is an element lacking in Leni, it's that the drama has only one pace and one mood. It lacks the archetypal introduction, development and crescendo of resolution. It poses many tough questions, leaving it to the viewer to ponder Leni Riefenstahl's intentions, and more importantly, an artist's obligation to society.\nLeni runs through May 7.

Photo: Bob HakinsThe Bay Area has harbored a deep love for New Orleans music for more than seven decades, from the vogue for traditional jazz that defined the scene in the 1940s through regular visits by contemporary combos like the Rebirth Brass Band and Galactic. Some of the greatest Crescent City players settled here (see: Modeliste, Zigaboo) and our region has long been enriched by waves of African Americans from Louisiana initially settled drawn to the East Bay drawn by work in the World War II shipyards.\nBut pianist, cornetist, guitarist, vocalist and bandleader Macy Blackman, who celebrates the release of his new album with the Mighty Fines, Shoorah Shoorah: The Songs of Irma Thomas and Allen Toussaint at the Back Room on Sunday, doesn't need any elaborate explanations for the Bay Area's abiding passion for New Orleans grooves. \"There's no place in the US where people wouldn't like this,\" he says. \"But it's true that the Bay Area is real attuned to the arts.\"\nListening to Shoorah Shoorah, it's easy to see Blackman's point. He plays rollicking, good-time music and his band brings together some of the Bay Area's finest players, including tenor saxophonist/vocalist Nancy Wright, baritone saxophonist Ken \"Snakebite\" Jacobs, bassist Bing Nathan, and drummer Larry Vann (who played with New Orleans soul queen Irma Thomas when she lived in the East Bay four decades ago).\nThe album draws primarily on classic Toussaint songs associated with Thomas, like \"Lipstick Traces,\" \"Ruler of My Heart\" and \"Take A Look,\" \"which is really Nancy's masterpiece,\" Blackman says. \"I wanted all the songs to be different. There's no blues. The closest thing to a blues is 'Hittin' On Nothing.' There were some pieces I'd never heard before, like 'Shoorah Shoorah, and others I knew we had to include. The first one, 'Working in the Coal Mine,' is based Allen's arrangement not Lee Dorsey's.\"\n\nL to R: Kenny \"Snakebit\" Jacobs, Nancy Wright, Bing Nathan, Macy Blackman, and Larry Vann, looking mighty fine. Photo: Courtesy the artistsBlackman absorbed the intricacies of New Orleans beats and an extensive repertoire of Crescent City R&B directly from drummer Charles \"Hungry\" Williams, who along with Earl Palmer defined the classic New Orleans R&B sound of the 1950s and '60s. They met in the 1978 and formed a fast friendship, playing music together until the drummer's death in 1986.\nNancy Wright recently got a dose of New Orleans directly from the source after heading to Jazz Fest last year, and ended up landing impromptu gigs with Marcia Ball and Elvin Bishop. The trip was prompted by her dejection over Toussaint's death in the fall of 2015. \"I was thanking God such a beautiful artist existed, and I stayed upset,\" she says. \"I cleared a month on my schedule just to go be in New Orleans and try to find whatever work I can.\"\nAlready one of the most sought after blues saxophonists in Northern California (she's up for a Blues Music Award for best instrumentalist), Wright returned to Oakland sounding more soulful than ever. She recently released her third album as a leader, Playdate, a talent-packed project with a succession of guest stars, including her former employers Elvin Bishop and Joe Louis Walker, powerhouse vocalists Wee Willie Walker, Frank Bey, and Terrie Odabi, and guitarslingers Tommy Castro, Mighty Mike Schermer, and Chris Cain (whom she'll be joining at Biscuits & Blues on April 4).\nWith Toussaint's death and Irma Thomas's late career resurgence, the time seems ripe for Shoorah Shoorah. Over the past decade, she's released a series of sensational albums, starting with 2006's anguished but unbowed response to Hurricane Katrina After the Rain, which earned her a belated first Grammy. She followed up with the winning concept album Simply Grand (both on Rounder), a stripped down project pairing her with a succession of master pianists like Dr. John, Jon Cleary, Davel Crawford and Marcia Ball.\nThomas's ties to the Bay Area run deep. When work dried up back home and she had to get a day job at Montgomery Ward in the early 1970s, she kept getting calls for gigs in California. With four children to feed she figured it made sense to relocate, and ended up moving to Oakland in the spring of 1972. She landed a regular gig at the Off Plaza Lounge, often working with organist Chester Thompson (until he joined Tower of Power). She sang with the Dynamic Four, the Uptights and other top Bay Area R&B outfits while holding onto her day job until she moved back to Louisiana in 1976.\nFor Blackman, who's steeped in a century of New Orleans sounds, celebrating Toussaint and Thomas is an ideal assignment for the Mighty Fines. The band is celebrating its 10th anniversary, and has earned a dedicated following among savvy listeners and dancers. They return to San Francisco's Balancoire Night Club for a swing dance night on March 29.\nRecommended gig: Melanie O'Reilly\nMelanie O'Reilly plays the second concert in the Third Sunday Concert Series at St. Alban's Episcopal Church Sunday.

Photo: Blair BrownWhen talking to Dante Ryan it's hard to believe that he's only 19 years old. Just last year, he was a senior at Berkeley High School. Now, he seems to have a very clear understanding of who he is and what he wants to give to the world. A young man of many talents, Ryan has maximized his gifts. Whether it is music or politics, Ryan has his mind set on giving anything he is involved with his all.\nThe product of a biracial family, the Berkeley native, who performs as The Dante Ryan, recently signed a distribution deal with Empire, and has just released his first project, \"Toxic Fool.\" We checked in with Ryan to talk about his inspirations and ambitions.\nHow did you get started with music?\nIt's actually a funny story, and it's crazy how vividly I can remember this, but when I was around six years old, \"Let me love you\" by Mario was a huge hit and my older sister was always playing it, constantly on repeat. And I really liked the song, the beat, the melody, and I would be dancing to it when no-one was around. \n\nThen one day my sister had her friends over and they were just playing some music, and then \"Let me love you\" comes on, and by then I already memorized it, so I just started singing to all the girls, and I'm dancing all while the song plays. And instead of them making fun of me or laughing, they actually really enjoyed it. They were clapping and cheering for me, and I'll never forget the feeling I got when they responded so well to my performance. Putting that energy out and to have them reciprocate it, I felt on top of the world. So after that I talked to my mom, who had sung in the choir growing up, and my father who once was a rapper, and I told them how I really enjoyed singing and dancing, and they just started getting me involved in acting programs, I started doing musicals, and from there I just kept it going.\nYou come from a family that has a musical background. How have they influenced you as an artist?\nAs a kid, my parents always played the best music. Both are from the Fillmore district of San Francisco, and that area has a lot of culture. They did a really good job of exposing my siblings and myself to different types of music. I also think me being biracial played a big role in me being exposed to different genres of music. My mom would play me local artists from the San Francisco area, and then her side of the family is originally from Louisiana, so I'm just getting all these types of music from my mom, and then my dad is playing stuff from the '60s and '70s. My grandmother is playing classical music, I'm hearing reggae, my grandfather was into the opera. So I'm hearing all this different stuff, and I'm enjoying all of it. So I think being exposed to all those genres definitely had a positive impact on me. I'm able to find motivation and ideas from all these different styles of music and put my own twist on it.\nAt what point did you decide you would start doing music full-time?\nThere were stages to that decision, because of course, actions speak louder than words. So there's saying you're going to do something, and then actually following through with actions that match what you said you were going to do. So I've been saying I wanted to be a successful artist when I was in the 7th grade when I started this group called \"The Newcomers\". There was one day we were messing around at a friend's house, and we made this mash up of \"99 Problems\" by Jay-Z and \"New Soul\" by Yael Naim, and that got over 3 million views on YouTube [the original video was taken down for copyright reasons], people were using it in Vines, and other videos, but we never got credit. But seeing that our product had such a positive reaction and enjoying our creativity, I knew that we had potential.\nSo that was the moment when I was like \"I'm about to do this. This is what I'm trying to do.\" And then the last year has really made me realize how much I just need to be involved in music. Whether it's as an artist, a manager, or me helping other artists anyway, I have to be working in music. Over the last year I've been spending more time with people in the industry and working on my craft more and I've just really grown to love what I do and what it has to offer. I know it's not easy and like every form of entertainment, whether it's acting or sports, the chances of being a superstar are slim, but my love for the craft is enough for me to give it all I have.\nI always see you giving a lot of love, and paying homage to the city of Berkeley. How has Berkeley helped mold you as an artist and as an individual?\nOne of the things I've always admired about Berkeley is the diversity, and the community's willingness to be open and accepting of all people. As a biracial kid, that was really big for me. I always felt like I could just be me. Whoever that was. I could embody all the things that make me, me. I didn't have to be just white, or just Black. I could be both, and people appreciated and respected that. I've been able to translate that diversity into my music. I can rap, sing, and produce. Each artistry allows me to tap into a different part of myself, and I would like to think Berkeley played a part in allowing me to develop that level of trust and comfort in who I am.\n\nIn such a short time you've been able to experience so much. Apart from music, you've been involved in politics, right?\nYes, I was. I started doing Youth and Government my sophomore year.\nCan you tell me about that experience and what your role was?\nOriginally I was skeptical about joining the Berkeley delegation. For those who aren't familiar with Youth and Government, it's pretty much all white people, so that was a red flag for me. I didn't want to be a part of something that wasn't inclusive. But my best friend at the time kept encouraging me. He thought I could be an asset to the delegation, and on top of that, he told about all the girls that I would meet... I was instantly convinced!\nWe had to do a debate on something like, \"Which is better: Gordo's or Cactus?\"So I go to my first meeting and I was extremely shy, but we had to do a debate on something like, \"Which is better: Gordo's or Cactus?\" I made an argument for Gordo's. I had very little experience with debating and public speaking, but everybody was feeling my argument, and it was very reminiscent of when I would perform music, it just felt good. Being able to change people's minds, and offer a new perspective, that moment was really cool and from there I just kind of kept the ball rolling. Over the next two years I just moved up in rank.\nI ran for secretary my junior year, and I won that race. Then by senior year I had made a bunch of friends and kind of made a name for myself, so I decided to run for president, and I won that. All these positions that I held at the delegation really taught me a lot.\nI plan to run my own business one day and the tools that I gained from Y&G will put me in a position to be successful with that endeavor. And also, I learned a lot about politics and how government is run. You know, the government, some people like it, some people don't, but it's a crucial part of our society. Especially in America. And this particular time with all that's going on, it's important that we know how things actually work and the most effective ways to go about creating change. So yeah, I'll always be grateful for the experiences and knowledge I gained through Youth and Government.\nWhat are some of your other interest outside of music and politics?\nI took a year off from school to give music all my attention and follow my dreams, but I still plan on going back to school and getting my degree. I want to major in business. Like I said, I want to run my own business, so going back to school is definitely something I think about often. I enjoy writing, anything that allows me to expressive myself. I do have some interest in journalism. I'm sure you can relate to the feeling you get when you get to just learn about people and hear about what they've been through. Their passions, their traumas, that's something I'd like to explore.\nWhat can fans expect from you next with music?\nRight now I have a bunch of things in the works. I have something going right now called \"Honest Mondays,\" where every Monday I release some form of art. Mondays can be a tough day for people and I want them to start their weeks off with some positivity. I also have an EP that I'm releasing on March 13 titled \"Toxic Fool,\" that I'm really excited about. I would like to start releasing an EP every month or so. I have an album that I'm working on, \"Eclipse.\" I don't know when I'll be releasing that. I want to take my time with it. Albums are different from EPs in the sense that an album is how you're marketing yourself. You're telling the music world, \"This is me and this is how I want you to think of me when you listen to my music.\" EPs tend to be shorter and more experimental.\nWhat are your goals with music?\nI just want to inspire, I want people to escape reality when they listen to my music. A lot of people are down right now. You can look at the world and see that spirits are not high. I want to uplift people. I want people to listen to my music and get motivated to make a difference and strive to be the best they can be. If that happens, I'll be satisfied.\nDante Ryan will be live in concert on April 12, at 1015 Folsom in San Francisco. Tickets available.

Taking its title from an engineering project, Haiku Tunnel remains one of the funniest films of this still young century, its analysis of the absurdities of the gig economy prescient, razor sharp, and endlessly amusing.\nNow Kornbluth and Keith return in Jacob Kornbluth's Love and Taxes (opening at Rialto Cinemas Elmwood on Friday, March 17), not so much a sequel as a complimentary feature to its predecessor. Based around Josh's recent monologue of the same name, the film blends performance footage with recreations of our hero's efforts to make good with both the Franchise Tax Board and his future wife.\nWhereas Haiku Tunnel focused on Josh's inability to complete a critical work assignment, Love and Taxes follows his almost decade-long struggle with, well, love and taxes. Also returning from Haiku Tunnel (but now in different roles) are Harry Shearer (as Josh's Hollywood agent), Sarah Overman (as love interest Sarah) and the magnificent Helen Shumaker (as Moe, the tax consultant who gets Josh to sign over his rights to his first film in lieu of payment for her services).\nWhen Josh asks himself the question \"how could I find a woman I could love as much as I loved my father?\", the answer, naturally, is \"tax law\". Despite working for virile practitioner of the taxation arts Shelby (who expounds on the wonders of such arcane legal devices as reverse double dummy maneuvers and collapsible corporation rulings), Josh sheepishly admits to his boss that he hasn't filed a return in seven years.\n\nBob refers his penitent to Moe, who approaches the issue from a psychoanalytic direction. Plumbing the depths of Josh's deepest childhood memories, she determines that his problem (or is it a symptom?) stems from his close relationship with his father, a Communist who resolutely refused to fund The Man's wars.\nConvinced Josh has it within himself to make good on his debt to society, Moe declares she won't charge him any fees until he becomes rich and famous. And therein lies the problem: Josh's success as a stand-up comedian and fledgling movie star exposes him not only to tax debt but to her exorbitant professional fees.\nHis bespectacled face still baby smooth, this balding yet stringy-haired schlemiel appears to have aged not a bit since 2001. No-one else can quiver a lip or raise an eyebrow quite as effectively as Kornbluth, his subtle physical comedy (occasionally punctuated by brief outbursts of frantic arm-waving) perfectly complementing his old-school neurotic humor.\nThe film's highlight might be his routine about Sacramento's Franchise Tax Board, in which these most terrifying of bureaucrats are re-imagined as a warm-hearted family of Italian immigrants - or it might be the cameo appearance by Berkeley's favorite economist Robert Reich, here cast as the former commissioner of the IRS. Either way, this is the funniest film you'll see all year, and a most worthy successor to its illustrious predecessor.\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "Big Screen Berkeley: 'Love and Taxes'", "Tags": "['Big Screen Berkeley', 'Movies']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'Movies']", "Natural Language Location": "Rialto Cinemas Elmwood", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8566908", "Zip Code": "94705", "ID": "251344", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2531368", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/16/big-screen-berkeley-love-taxes/", "Author": "John Seal", "Date": "2017-03-16T09:00:36-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Catherine Castellanos (Connie Gonzalez), left, and Sara Bruner (Norma McCorvey) in Roe at Berkeley Rep. Photo: Jenny GrahamSince its Supreme Court ruling in 1973, Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the United States, has been a lightning rod that continues to electrify public opinion. It serves as a seismograph that registers politicians' and citizens' viewpoints, very few of whom are undecided about how women should make their pregnancy choices.\nTurning constitutional litigation into a fascinating and sometimes humorous human story, notable playwright Lisa Loomer traces the history of Roe v. Wade from just before the first 1970 meeting in Texas among three women in their 20s, Norma McCorvey, the named plaintiff known as Jane Roe, and her attorneys, Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee. Roe ends, with a bit of late re-writing, at McCorvey's recent death on February 18, 2017.\nNorma McCorvey (excellent Sara Bruner) is presented as a bit of a wild child who had already given birth to two children, but was raising neither, who abused drugs and alcohol, was gay, and whose mother was a nasty piece of work. But Norma McCorvey was pregnant again, and that was all that mattered to attorneys Sarah Weddington (first-rate Sarah Jane Agnew, Don Juan Giovanni) and Linda Coffee, who dropped out of the picture early (well-acted by Susan Lynskey). The lawyers were itching to test Texas's onerous anti-abortion law, which criminalized doctors who performed abortions, regardless of the health or life of the mother.\nAmy Newman (Gloria Allred) and Sara Bruner (Norma McCorvey) in Roe at Berkeley Rep. Photo: Jenny GrahamThe action of the play follows the chronology of the lawsuit, and then, the continuing lives of McCorvey and Weddington. The first act contains a dramatic re-enactment of the Supreme Court hearings (there were actually two), with recordings of the justices questioning the litigators. Weddington, at 27, was then, and remains today, the youngest person to argue successfully before the high court.\n\nThe production also portrays the unfortunate misunderstandings and misconceptions that pervaded the relationship between McCorvey and Weddington. McCorvey initially thought that bringing the case would help end her pregnancy, but of course, litigation that winds its way to the Supreme Court often take years to be resolved. And although Weddington knew of a \"safe\" abortionist in Mexico, she never shared that information with McCorvey. Weddington related to her as a vehicle to help the cause, not as a person in need.\nAfter the Roe v. Wade decision, McCorvey spent many quiet years working in pro-choice health clinics with her sympathetic live-in partner, Connie (skillfully acted by Catherine Castellanos). In a dramatic turnaround, Operation Rescue, the virulent anti-abortion organization, moved in next door to McCorvey's clinic. They proselytized and finally converted her. McCorvey became an outspoken opponent of abortion rights.\nDirector Bill Rauch (Broadway's All the Way) has succeeded in making this remarkable story come alive. The staging of Roe is surprisingly theatrical for a fact-driven performance piece. The stage is often divided into two sets, which enables the audience to watch two different activities simultaneously. So for example, the audience watches Connie sitting solitarily at home while Norma McCorvey is being baptized into her new faith.\nRoe, originally commissioned by the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, then co-produced by Washington, DC's Arena Stage and our own Berkeley Rep, was thoroughly researched by playwright Loomer, who read Weddington's book and McCorvey's two books on the subject. Excerpts from these books effectively illustrate the differences in their recollection of key facts. Occasionally, breaks in the fourth wall are thoughtfully employed to add detail and give updates on minor characters, as though in a footnote.\nRoe is an enthralling drama about the personalities behind the life-changing momentous decision, in addition to being an engaging exploration of the litigation itself and the pro-choice and anti-abortion movements. It's an important story in a very well-presented and performed play that all should see.\nRoe runs through April 7.

Photo: Luna ProductionsWhen Marian Diamond was growing up in Southern California, she got her first glimpse of a real brain at Los Angeles County Hospital with her dad, a physician. She was 15. Looking back now, at age 90, Diamond, a Berkeley resident, points to that moment as the start of something profound -- a curiosity, wonderment, drive.\n\"It just blew my mind, the fact that a cell could create an idea,\" Diamond said in a recent interview, reflecting on her first encounter with that sinewy purple-tinged mass.\nShe didn't know that this was the start of a distinguished legacy that would stretch for decades, touching millions. But today, she'd be one of the first to scientifically equate that adolescent thrill with her life's work.\nBecause she helped prove a link.\n\nBrains, we now know, thanks in large part to research by Diamond, thrive on challenge, newness, discovery. With this enrichment, brain cells are stimulated and grow.\nThis week, Diamond, a UC Berkeley emeritus professor of integrative biology and the first woman to earn a PhD in anatomy at Cal, is being honored by the Berkeley City Council, which is designating March 14 as Marian Diamond Day.\nAnd on March 22, KQED TV will air a new documentary film about her life's work, My Love Affair With the Brain. (Scroll down to watch the trailer.)\nThe city's resolution reads in part: \"Dr. Diamond is one of the founders of modern neuroscience, her research established that the human brain can be altered by either enriched or impoverished environments at any age from prenatal to extremely old age, and as a consequence changed the way we think about plasticity of the brain.\"\nDiamond, who raised four kids in Berkeley, retired from UC Berkeley three years ago after nearly 60 years of teaching. It turned out that her passion for research was matched by a second love, teaching others what she had learned.\nAnd she was effective.\nIn addition to earning raves from decades of UC Berkeley classroom students, Diamond became a YouTube teaching superstar. Her online lessons have received 1.7 million hits and counting, making her a global educational sensation.\n\"My siblings and I have all been teachers and that's no surprise given that she was so invested in teaching,\" said Rick Diamond, one of Marian Diamond's children and an expert in sustainable energy building design who recently retired from the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. \"It's so much a part of who she is.\"\nDiamond's riveting YouTube lectures, breakthrough brain research, and pioneering status as a woman in science caught the attention of Berkeley documentary film producers Catherine Ryan and Gary Weimberg, of Luna productions.\nRyan had taken what she described as a month-long sabbatical from daily work to immerse herself in UC Berkeley culture and academia in search of film material, sitting in on classes, pouring over her computer. Specifically, after finishing a movie about the Iraq war, Soldiers of Conscience, the team was looking for something a little more upbeat.\n\"I went online and looked at the first two of [Diamond's] YouTube anatomy lectures and thought, 'Wow, science, a woman, good news about anatomy, good news about what's happening in the brain.' I was just completely turned on and that's what launched it,\" Ryan said.\nAsking around, it didn't take long for Ryan to find an acquaintance who knew Diamond. They had lunch at the Berkeley Faculty Club, and the project grew roots.\nMy Love Affair with the Brain has its local PBS debut March 22 (8 p.m., Channel 9) but has screened nationally for about a year, winning numerous awards. The film hits a delightful balance of telling a story about a scientist, and about science. Actress Mayim Bialik, who plays a neuroscientist in the The Big Bang Theory TV show and is a real-life neuroscientist, narrates.\nIt helps that Diamond, who agreed to the film only when assured it would teach science, Ryan said, is charming, funny, easy to understand, and twinkles with enthusiasm.\nHer trademark teaching-tool: an elegant floral hatbox, from which she gently lifts out a pickled brain.\n\"People come up to us and say 'my life has changed by watching this film,'\" Weimberg said. \"They suddenly are more connected to their own brain.\"\nMarian Diamond in 1984. Photo: Luna ProductionsBeing a woman scientist is less significant to Diamond than to many of her admirers, Rick Diamond, Weimberg and Ryan agree. \"She doesn't like being labeled as a woman scientist or a feminist, she just did what she wanted to do,\" Rick Diamond said.\nDiamond's research helped prove that the brain can physically change in response to external stimulation, growing cells when exposed to enriching experiences, even in older age. And that without enrichment, the brain can shrink.\nThis opened the gate to critical new thinking in many arenas including childhood education, senior care, the immune system, and general lifestyle health.\nBefore this, the accepted scientific belief was that brain growth was predetermined by genetics, static, and not influenced by external elements.\nDiamond was also the first scientist to study and publish findings on Einstein's brain, a chapter that proved controversial for a few reasons, but advanced understanding on the importance of glial cells which surround, protect and nourish neurons, the brain's activity cells.\nThe film, which included among its audience-testers 150 Berkeley High students, is also poignant: introducing Diamond as she retires, capturing her contagious joy of teaching and her devotion to using her research to improve lives.\nThe film and Berkeley proclamation come at a time when Diamond's health is declining. Yet she is still cheerful, according to her son.\n\"She really believed and embodied that one person can make a difference,\" Rick Diamond said, \"Whether as a teacher, researcher, writer or friend.\"\n\nMy Love Affair with the Brain    (60 second promo) from Luna Productions on Vimeo.\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "Berkeley honors Marian Diamond, who radically changed how we think about the brain", "Tags": "['Berkeley City Council', 'UC Berkeley']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'Community', 'Movies', 'UC Berkeley']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley City Council", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8694486", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "251402", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2730616", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/14/berkeley-honors-marian-diamond-radically-changed-think-brain/", "Author": "Kate Darby Rauch", "Date": "2017-03-14T14:00:57-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "In 1960, as transportation engineers laid out plans to build BART around the Bay, the Berkeley City Council passed a resolution calling for the line to be underground within city limits.\nBut when BART officials unveiled the actual plan in the spring of 1962, it called for the underground section in Berkeley to run only from Shattuck Avenue at Derby to around Milvia and Hearst streets. The northern and southern sections of the rail line would be above ground, as would be the two stations.\nFor about a year, no one seemed to notice. It was not until Wallace Johnson was elected as Berkeley's new mayor in 1963 that the city sat up, paid attention, and launched a fight and bond measure campaign that eventually assured BART would run under Berkeley's streets, according to a new history of BART by Michael Healy, the rail line's former spokesman.\nHealy will be speaking about BART: The Dramatic History of the Bay Area Rapid Transit System today, March 14, at 5:30 p.m. at University Books, 2430 Bancroft Ave. Heyday Books is the publisher.\n\nJohnson, a Republican, thought an elevated track would be an eyesore - and accentuate the city's racial divide since the train would run along Grove Street, now known as Martin Luther King, Jr. Way.\nAn editorial cartoon from the 1960s depicting Berkeley's battles with BART. Photo: Michael Healy\"Wally Johnson was concerned that an aerial structure would divide the city socially, plus the aesthetics and general environmental negatives,\" said Healy.\nTo rally citizens around a bond measure to pay to underground BART, Johnson paid to erect scaffolding about 30 feet high in two neighborhoods, one on the north end and one on the south end of the city, where the planned BART line was to go through. The soaring structure demonstrated the mass of the stations and what they would look like. The anti-aerial Berkeley Citizen's Committee raised $14,000 to pay for large signs that were posted around the city that read \"Bury The Bart Tracks,\" said Healy.\nThere were numerous public hearings, testy exchanges between Berkeley and BART officials, thousands of pages of recorded testimony, and scads of articles, television and radio spots and editorials over the issue. Healy's book goes into detail about the battle, as well as other interesting tidbits about the creation of BART and its various controversies. In the end, Berkeley residents decided to pay for the undergrounding themselves. On Oct. 4, 1966, Berkeley voters approved a $20.4 million bond measure by 80%.\nIn an ironic twist, Johnson, the man who fought hard against BART's original plans, was appointed in 1966 to the BART board of directors.\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "Fight to underground BART in Berkeley one of many tales told in new book", "Tags": "['BART']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'Books']", "Natural Language Location": "2430 Bancroft Way", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8682758", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "251321", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2628785", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/14/fight-underground-bart-berkeley-one-many-tales-told-new-book/", "Author": "Frances Dinkelspiel", "Date": "2017-03-14T10:30:50-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Erica Deeman's photography exhibition of African diaspora women Silhouettes runs at BAMPFA through June 11. Photo: Anastasiia SaponElegant and homey, dignified and self-possessed, mysterious and soulful, the 30 black women captured in photographer Erica Deeman's new Silhouettes series at BAMPFA make for excellent company.\nFilling a spacious but intimate downstairs gallery, the striking portraits, all shot in profile against a stark white background, are the work of an artist whose precipitous rise seems perfectly in tune with our cultural moment. The first comprehensive presentation of the collection of photographs, and Deeman's first solo museum exhibition, Silhouettes opened Wednesday March 8 and runs through June 11.\n\"I've always had so many questions around the face, about how we look to read and understand the face, and maybe assign assumptions,\" says Deeman, 40. \"Throughout art history we've seen all these faces through painting, sculpture, photography and even literature. With the Silhouettes project the basic premise was how we still in modern day assign certain attributes to the face.\"\nThe English-born Deeman started working on the series while she was studying at San Francisco's Academy of Art University and in many ways it flowed out of her own experience. Raised in the Midlands city of Nottingham, she grew up in a mixed-racial family with her white British father and Black Jamaican mother. Moving to San Francisco in 2011 to study, she became very aware of how people's response to her changed before and after she spoke, as her British accent revealed her origins.\n\n\"I feel that in some way I'm seen in a different way than in the UK, and it drives me to ask these different questions,\" she says. \"It's a fascinating journey through life getting comfortable with how you are perceived. Then you come to a different country and that narrative is not granted to everybody that looks like you.\"\n\"Untitled 02\" 2014. By Erica DeemanDeeman started gathering subjects by setting up her camera outside of school and approaching passersby on the street. She hit up friends and posted an ad on Craigslist looking for African diaspora women interested in being photographed. What started as a school project took on more weight when Pier 24 photography director Christopher McCall happened to see one of her images.\nShe'd been volunteering regularly at the Embarcadero institution, which houses the Pilara Foundation's extensive permanent collection, and McCall encouraged her to refine and expand the series. Several images from Silhouettes made a powerful impression in last year's Pier 24 Photography group exhibition Collected.\nThat's how BAMPFA director and chief curator Lawrence Rinder first heard about Deeman's work. The museum's programming is usually booked out for two years, but an unexpected open slot allowed him to showcase an obviously gifted artist just as her career takes off.\n\"Her work is really timely, and I didn't want to wait,\" Rinder says. \"We had a chance to do something that hadn't been done. All 30 Silhouettes had never been shown together, and the gallery is magically exactly the right size. I find the images very moving. They're obviously beautiful, but there's also a duality of strength and tenderness.\"\n\"Untitled 07\" 2014. By Erica DeemanThere are so many ways to take in the images. At first glance the photos appear to be black and white. But hints of blues and reds reveals that they're actually shot in color. One can enjoy it as a study in the intricacies of black women's hair, with braids, dreads, carefully coifed Afros, naturals, straightened looks. \"There's so much of the individual in each image, but there's this collective as well,\" Deeman says. \"You can take time to engage with the images and see the differences, and maybe look at how you assign expectations in your mind.\"\nPart of what makes the exhibition so effective is the unified aesthetic. Roughly half the women are posed looking right and half looking left. They are all framed from the shoulders up. Some are more in profile than others, and each is lovingly lit so that her eye and decolletage reflect the light (no clothing is visible in any photo).\nIt's not surprising to find out that Deeman spent years working in advertising before reinventing herself as a photographer. Rather than creating a campaign to promo a product or brand, she's interrogating the history of documenting black women, bringing dignity and affection to a troubled practice that intersects with physiognomy and pseudoscience.\n\"I recognize certain elements of my experience, a seamless and recognizable visual consistency that you can align to creative campaigns,\" she says. \"In advertising you have X amount of seconds to sell something or make them feel something. With art there's the ability to layer the work and create five different entry points.  Advertising is a relatively closed agenda. I want something more open.\"\nThe BAMPFA exhibition would be a major coup for any relatively unknown artist. But Deeman's work will soon be on view on both sides of the Bay. Her series looking at men of the African diaspora, Brown, opens at Anthony Meier Fine Arts in San Francisco on March 24 and runs through April 28. Needless to say, she is thrilled by her work's reception.\n\"Sometimes I do have to pinch myself,\" she says. \"It is a very quick rise. I feel very lucky to have such a great network of people who believe in my work. I have worked very hard, volunteering at arts organizations, creating a network that surpassed anything I could have expected.\"\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "Erica Deeman's 'Silhouettes' at BAMPFA makes a powerful impression", "Tags": "['BAMPFA']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts']", "Natural Language Location": "BAMPFA", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8707845", "Zip Code": "94720", "ID": "251162", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2686016", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/13/erica-deemans-silhouettes-bampfa-makes-powerful-impression/", "Author": "Andrew Gilbert", "Date": "2017-03-13T07:00:38-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Two Canadian companies, Kidd Pivot and Electric Theatre Company, come to Cal Performances on Friday and Saturday.

Photo: Kingmon YoungBobi Cespedes has lived in the United States four time times longer than she spent in her native Cuba, but the island's verdant culture soaked into her marrow and she's dedicated herself to bringing Afro-Cuban rhythms and rituals to her adopted homeland. A relatively scarce presence on Bay Area stages in recent years -- she was concentrating on getting a daycare center up and running at her house in Oakland -- Cespedes settles into Ashkenaz this weekend to fulfill her dual roles as incandescent performer and charismatic educator.\nAs part of the venue's Maestra Series, a sensational month of programming presented in collaboration with Carolyn Brandy's San Leandro-based Women Drummers International, the majestic Cespedes performs with her formidable band and special guest percussionists John Santos and Javier Navarette on Saturday night. She also gives a Sunday afternoon workshop, Songs to the Female Orishas, which features members of her band and Brandy.\n\"I have worked with Carolyn Brandy before and she's an incredible musician, an excellent drummer, a fantastic person, and a member of my religious tradition,\" Cespedes says, referring to the Afro-Cuban Yoruba-Lucumi tradition (also known as Santeria). She and Brandy, one of the first women to master the bata, a double-headed drum essential to Santeria. They collaborated back in 1990 on Skin Talk: An Ancestral Ballet of Women, an acclaimed production commissioned for the SF World Drum Festival.\nThe Maestra series runs through the end of the month, and includes Sunday's benefit for Madre in support of Syrian women refugees. The acts include Berkeley choreographer Miriam Peretz's Nava Dance Collective, the Bay Area Bomba y Plena Workshop performing dance and drumming from Puerto Rico, and and Shamma Ensemble, which features members of acclaimed world music group Stellamara (Sonja Drakulich, Briana Di Mara, Gari Hegedus, Dan Cantrell), and other special guests. The series concludes on March 28 with \"Lafayette Sisters,\" a night of Cajun and Creole music led by Berkeley fiddler, guitarist and singer Suzy Thompson. The concert is benefit for Faith House, a Lafayette, Louisiana organization that provides shelter and other services to victims of domestic violence.\n\n\nFor Saturday's concert, Cespedes, who also plays chekere, will be joined by Marco Diaz on piano, trumpet, and vocals, Saul Sierra-Alonso on bass and vocals, Jose Roberto Hernandez on guitar and vocals, Morris Amaya on trumpet, and Lichi Fuentes on vocals, chekere and guiro. Born in Chile, Fuentes met Cespedes at La Pena Cultural Center shortly after moving to the US in 1981. At the time, they were both singing songs associated with the Latin American nueva trova movement, but Cespedes soon went on to found Conjunto Cespedes with her nephew Guillermo Cespedes, introducing authentic Cuban folkloric music to the region. Like so many other Bay Area musicians who went on to immerse themselves in Afro-Cuban music, Fuentes joined Conjunto Cespedes and sang with the ensemble for eight years.\n\"The conversation around the group was always, is this salsa? No, this is Afro-Cuban music, not just this exciting rhythm to move your hips to,\" says Fuentes, a long-time Berkeleyan who has directed La Pena's community chorus for two decades. \"They were really invested in preserving the roots of Afro-Cuban music, and demonstrating the difference between a son, a guaguanco, a rumba. It was this school about the tradition and folklore from Cuba, exploring the whole history of religion, discrimination and class. I was very ignorant about all that until I joined Conjunto Cespedes.\"\nBobi Cespedes embodies that extraordinary history. Though she grew up in the 1950s her consciousness stretches back for generations. The youngest of 14 children, she was raised in the midst of a musical family and steeped in Afro-Cuban culture. Her paternal grandmother was Congolese, and though she died before Cespedes was born, the music, stories, and cultural knowledge she passed on from the Old World resounded through the Cespedes family. \"The tradition and folklore of the Yoruba and Congolese is all over Cuba, inside of everybody's blood, one way or another,\" says Cespedes, who also performs with the Junius Courtney Big Band at Freight & Salvage on April 12, joining the ensembles regular vocalist Denise Perrier.\nCespedes expanded her folkloric knowledge after moving to New York City in 1959, joining her mother and sisters in pursuit of an education. She studied and performed for four years with Sylvia del Villar, a renowned African-Puerto Rican vocalist and cultural activist. By her mid 20s, Cespedes had become a priestess of Obatala, a spiritual practice that continues to suffuse her life and music.\nAfter Conjunto Cespedes wound down, she continued her musical explorations and probably reached her widest audience as part of Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart's Planet Drum and Bembe Orisha projects. Always open to new sounds, she looked for connections between the African-derived music of her childhood and the African-American music that she absorbed living in Oakland. The styles all came together on 2002's Rezos (Six Degrees Records), a captivating musical synthesis that producer Greg Landau called \"funkloric.\"\nWhile Rezos launched her solo career, Cespedes ended up spending far more time in the classroom than on stage. She spent the five years from 2006-10 teaching teachers about Afro-Cuban culture through San Francisco State's Head Start Program (a pedagogy documented in the book Soy Bilingue Adult Dual Language Model for Early Childhood and Elementary Teacher Education, which includes contributions by Cespedes, Ronald Rosario, Roman Carrillo, Sharon Cronin and others).\n\"It's not just about having a cultural arts component in a school,\" Cespedes says. \"Our curriculum brings music and folklore into every aspect of the class.\"\nAfro-Cuban music and folklore will fill Ashkenaz on Sunday afternoon, when Cespedes will share chants praising and evoking her favorite female orishas, starting with Yemaya, who represents the ocean. \"Every orisha person has a couple of orishas that especially speak to them,\" she says. \"Yemaya is my mother and Obatala my father, my head orisha. I think the world is fond of Yemaya. Everybody in the world loves the ocean. But I'm going to speak a little about each orisha that I sing for. I have eight orishas, so don't know if I'll have time to sing them all.\"\nRecommended gig: Thomas Buckner\nNew music baritone vocalist Thomas Buckner performs Saturday in Berkeley.

There are so many choices - and so many opportunities for gluttony - that it's hard to know what to select. You can't see everything, and a festival guide can only tell you so much.\nFormerly known as the San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival, CAAMFest highlights films from Asia and the Asian diaspora. Programming the festival is surely a daunting task: how can you provide a representative selection of (for example) Korean or Vietnamese cinema, never mind that of an entire continent?\nThis is my long-winded way of excusing what will surely be some significant oversights in my CAAMFest 2017 coverage. I encourage readers to visit the festival's online schedule and discover their own hidden gems - these are merely the ones I found!\nBeyond its general historical interest, Finding Kukan (screening at Oakland's New Parkway at 3:20 p.m. on Saturday, March 18) will appeal to film preservation and restoration enthusiasts. The story of Li Ling Ai, the Chinese-American woman responsible for producing 1941's Kukan (the very first Academy Award-winning Best Documentary), Finding Kukan documents director Robin Lung's efforts to locate a complete and watchable print of the film, the only Oscar-winning doc not to exist in the Academy's archives.\n\nLung counterbalances the story of her search with that of her efforts to discover information confirming Ai's status as the film's producer. With early '40s America only tentatively starting to edge away from anti-Chinese racism, Hollywood was not eager to highlight her association with the film, instead crediting her as a 'technical advisor' while emphasizing the (by no means inconsiderable) contributions of cinematographer Rey Scott.\nThe Chinese Exclusion Act screens at the Castro Theatre in San FranciscoDealing exclusively with anti-Chinese racism, The Chinese Exclusion Act (screening at San Francisco's Castro Theatre at 7 p.m. on Sunday, March 18) offers an exhaustive history of America's decades-long legislative efforts to keep Chinese immigrants out of the country and prevent those already here from re-entering it should they travel abroad.\nThe two-and-a-half hour cut I screened will reportedly lose about 20 minutes of footage, hopefully resulting in a tighter but no less impactful film. For those unfamiliar with the Act, it will prove to be an eye-opener -- and a timely warning about the nativism once again dominating the national political scene.\nPlastic China is at the Roxie Theatre in San FranciscoPlastic China (screening at San Francisco's Roxie Theatre at 2:40 p.m. on Saturday, March 11) artfully documents the travails of a Tsingdao family who own and operate a 'factory' recycling imported-from-the-West plastic refuse into pellets (the utility of which isn't made clear). Home to thousands of similar businesses, Tsingdao's streets are literally lined with mountains of plastic detritus, but Plastic China's protagonists remain surprisingly upbeat in the face of unrelenting ugliness. I guess they don't have a choice.\nBitcoin Heist is at the New Parkway on Saturday March 18If you're looking for something a little less weighty, Vietnam's Bitcoin Heist (screening at the New Parkway at 5:40 p.m. on Saturday, March 18) is an enjoyable and colorful action comedy heavily indebted to recent Hong Kong crime films. Set in 2020, the film envisions a near future where the titular 'digital currency' has become the medium of choice among cyber criminals. Bring popcorn.\n'95 And 6 To Go is at the New People Cinema in San Francisco on March 19Finally, 95 And 6 To Go (screening at San Francisco's New People Cinema at 3 p.m. on Sunday, Marrch 19) is an odd duck indeed. Starring director Kimi Takesue's nonagenarian grandfather, it's a personal essay on love and mortality that I found only momentarily engaging. It's by no means bad, but will appeal to a relatively small sub-set of festival-goers.\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "Big Screen Berkeley: CAAMFest 2017 highlights films from Asia and the Asian diaspora", "Tags": "['Big Screen Berkeley', 'Movies']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'Movies']", "Natural Language Location": "The New Parkway Theater", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8138043", "Zip Code": "94612", "ID": "250537", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.267448", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/08/big-screen-berkeley-caamfest-2017/", "Author": "John Seal", "Date": "2017-03-08T09:30:09-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Ruth Whippman (right), in conversation with Lauren Schiller at the Uncharted Berkeley Festival of Ideas 2016.

Photo: Alessandra MelloUC Berkeley's Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies (TDPS) has created a first-rate production that would equally be at home on Addison Street as it is on the Cal campus. With fine direction by actor, director, playwright and educator Margo Hall, outstanding acting and sophisticated set, costume, lighting and sound design, the performance of playwright Naomi Iizuka's Polaroid Stories comes alive.\nIizuka (author of the 2010 Concerning Strange Devices From the Distant West at Berkeley Rep) wrote Polaroid Stories in 1997 in order to publicize the turbulent lives of runaway teenagers who fall into drugs, prostitution and homelessness. Written after interviewing Minneapolis street kids, the powerful and sobering drama consists of the actors speaking to the audience and telling their characters' life stories. Some accounts seem true, but most do not. In fact, the lies they tell about themselves are more shattering than the truth. We also observe interactions among the various characters as their allegiances and needs shift.\nPlaywright Iizuka has woven into the documentary-style drama the motif of the myths in Ovid's Metamorphoses, which unfortunately, gets lost in the sturm und drang of the characters' bitter lives. But some references to Ovid are obvious and fit more appropriately into the play. For example, D, or Dionysus (student Joe Ayers) is a drug dealer/god who expects to be worshipped; Narcissus (Akash Patel), a gay hustler, is suitably self-obsessed; and Eurydice (student Paris Shockley) needs to free herself of the oppressive love of Orpheus (Yohana Ansari-Thomas).\nThe UC Berkeley Department of Theater, Dance and Performance Studies cast of Polaroid Stories. Photo: Alessandra MelloAlthough the problem of teenagers living alone on unforgiving urban streets is as relevant today as it was twenty years ago when the play was written, there is a slightly dated quality about Polaroid Stories. And I'm not merely referring to the title. References, such as Narcissus wanting to appear on Ed McMahon's Star Search and some dated slang subtract from the immediacy of the piece.\n\nTDPS's choice to produce Polaroid Stories was certainly a more risky move than opting for a more conventional show with a beginning, a middle and an end. Polaroid Stories runs for almost two hours sans intermission and maintains a single, unrelentingly intense mood throughout. At instances, it is difficult to watch. Yet, Polaroid Stories succeeds largely because of the taut direction, the young actors who passionately embody their roles, the perfect garbage-strewn under-the-freeway set (Justine Law), the realistic sound design (Hannah Birch Carl), the effective lighting (Jack Carpenter) and the costuming (Wendy Sparks), rather than the content of the play itself.\nPolaroid Stories plays through March 12. Performances are at Zellerbach Playhouse on the UC campus, Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 2 p.m..

He will be performing \"The End of Journalism,\" from Feb. 15 to Feb. 18, and \"This is Not Normal,\" from Feb. 22 to 25. Daisey's first show \"tells the story of how journalism in America ended. From the rise of FOX News to the disruption of newspapers, to how Facebook replaced the television as the arbiter of truth, Daisey peels back the layers to find the darkly hilarious truth about the world we've made for ourselves.\" His second show \"addresses the precariousness of our current moment by examining the rise of autocracy and right-wing nationalism across the globe. From Putin's Russia to Berlusconi's Italy, from Le Pen in France to Trumpism here at home, Daisey crafts a portrait of the global and cultural forces that have helped lead America into the hands of a demagogue--and explains the push toward normalization from the left and right that always accompanies the rise of strongmen.\"\nDon't miss these other events featured on Berkeleyside:\nMichael Zilber, a saxophonist, celebrates his album's releaseBAMPFA's 'Hippie Modernism: The Struggle for Utopia'Academy-award nominated short filmsAurora Theater's 'The Real Thing'\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "The It List: Five things to do in Berkeley, weekend of Feb. 10-12", "Tags": "['What to do in Berkeley this weekend']", "Sections": "['Arts', 'Arts', 'Community', 'Events']", "Natural Language Location": "Live Oak Theater", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8838924", "Zip Code": "94709", "ID": "247881", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2691846", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/10/list-five-things-berkeley-weekend-feb-10-12/", "Author": "Berkeleyside Editors", "Date": "2017-02-10T14:36:18-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Available Light, a landmark work by choreographer Lucinda Childs, with music by John Adams and stage design by Frank Gehry, will be revived this weekend at Cal Performances.

It was also imperative to open a business that works on the principle of 'right livelihood'. That idea includes providing a higher 75/25 split for the artists, transparency with artists and clients, good wages to employees and having SHOH be a supportive member of the arts and local business community. As the costs of living in the Bay Area rise, one concern for many is that we will see an exodus of our most creative and talented residents.

Our building was built in the 1930s as a typewriter factory and maintenance shop. More recently the space has been the site of an auto-repair shop. We've done a floor-to-ceiling remodel of the space that included adding floor drains, putting in modern climate-control systems and building out spaces for play yards and sleeping accommodations. The Barkeley will be the first licensed dog daycare and hotel in the city of Berkeley.

Photo: John StoreyA few months ago, Mark Bulwinkle, the sculptor, praised the 3000 block of Claremont Avenue, home to Star Grocery, the Escapist, Afikomen, Jutta Flowers and more, as the quirkiest commercial block in Berkeley.\nWhat about it resonates with Bulwinkle?\nThe grocery store, particularly the meat department, reminds me exactly of the old Triple A supermarket I worked in as a teenager after school and summers in Weston, Massachusetts about 55 years ago. In fact, the whole strip, Turtle Island Book Shop and all, reminds me in a strange way of another era, way back then, in that little burg in New England. It's nice. I stop up there when I want to get a coffee at Semifreddi's [now closed] and drift back to then, the pre-Vietnam invasion era.\nI get it!

As I was preparing this post for publication, I learned that John Gordon, whose Gordon Commercial signs can be seen all over town, had made an offer on the building that houses all businesses northeast of Star Grocery (Pizazz, Afikomen, the French Cleaner, Lazlo's European Upholstery, Turtle Island Books, and Michelle Nelson Design). Gordon has restored a number of buildings around town, including the John Woolly House and the Ellen Blood House near People's Park.\n\"We love the building and have had frequented the businesses there for years,\" Gordon wrote in an email. \"We intend to operate the building much in the same manner as the sellers, who have had it in the family for three generations.

Photo: Google EarthThe American Apparel store on Telegraph Avenue, long a favorite place for UC Berkeley and Berkeley High students to shop for bright cotton clothing, will shut its doors at the end of April.\nThe closure comes after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November and sold its assets - but not its retail stores - in January to the Canadian company Gildan Activewear for $88 million. That deal should be finalized in February.\nGildan intends to incorporate American Apparel products into its extensive line of clothing, but will not operate separate stores.\nThe Daily Californian was the first to report that the Telegraph Avenue store would close.\n\nAmerican Apparel was well known for manufacturing its clothes in the United States, a fact that made many of its employees proud.\n\"I liked what the company's ideals were,\" said Christian Cruz, a 2016 graduate of UC Berkeley who works at the Telegraph Avenue store. \"They were a big supporter of LGBTQ rights, immigrant rights. Our stuff might be a little pricier but everything is well made, it's made in the U.S. and it's been made fairly. It's been a real joy,\" to work here, he said.\nAmerican Apparel for years also weathered controversy surrounding founder Dov Charney, who was embroiled in a number of sexual harassment suits filed by ex-employees. Charney was dismissed as CEO in 2014, and American Apparel has stumbled through a tough retail environment in the years since.\nCruz said the last official day of the store is April 30, but it may close sooner if it runs out of inventory. Right now, everything in the store is 40% off, he said.\nGildan Activewear has not yet decided where it will manufacture the American Apparel line, according to Garry Bell, vice president of corporate communications and marketing for Gildan. On one hand, it would be shortsighted not to capitalize on the brand's connection with the U.S., he said. Gildan does manufacture a small percentage of its products (socks and yarn made from American-grown cotton) in the United States in factories in Massachusetts and North Carolina. But the bulk of the company's 53,000-person workforce makes cloth and clothing in Gildan's factories in Honduras and the Dominican Republic, he said.\nThe days of thousands of workers sewing American Apparel clothing in Los Angeles appear to be over, however. The Los Angeles Times reported that American Apparel started laying off its 2,400 workers in Los Angeles on Monday, \"kicking off its final chapter as the country's largest garment maker.\"\nGildan, based in Montreal, produced 1 billion products in 2016 and 550 million pairs of socks, said Bell. The company makes T-shirts, fleece, sports shirts, and more under a number of brands including Gildan, Anvil Knitwear and Comfort Colors. It also sells the Gold Toe and Peds sock line.\nGildan also has a good track record of corporate responsibility, although it has never trumpeted its accomplishments as loudly as American Apparel did, said Bell.\nGildan manufactures 93% of its products in its own factories, according to Bell. More than half (51%) of the energy used to run those factories comes from renewable sources, mostly biomass. Around 89% of the company's waste gets repurposed or recycled. It has also reduced its water consumption by 17%, Bell said.\nGildan wholesales sells many of the T-shirts and sweatshirts it makes to retailers who then attach logos and resell the produce. Gildan has not yet decided if it will only wholesale American Apparel goods or also sell it to stores.\nStuart Baker, the executive director of the Telegraph Business Improvement District, said American Apparel will definitely be missed. The closure is indicative of the tough retail environment, which is playing out not only in Berkeley but around the country.\n\"It's indicative of the seismic shift in retail - the Elmwood is facing the same challenge,\" said Baker. \"Everyone is looking for a new model that will be a success.\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "Bankruptcy, sale mean American Apparel on Telegraph to close", "Tags": "['Berkeley business news', 'Southside Berkeley', 'Telegraph Avenue']", "Sections": "['Business', 'Business']", "Natural Language Location": "2301 Telegraph Ave", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8684995", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "246109", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2610467", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/01/27/bankruptcy-sale-means-american-apparel-store-telegraph-close-end-april/", "Author": "Frances Dinkelspiel", "Date": "2017-01-27T10:00:02-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Andronico's on Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley.

We're told, as of Saturday, an \"everything must go\" sale is underway at the North Berkeley store at 1550 Shattuck Ave.\nSafeway bought Andronico's Community Markets last year, and all five Andronico's stores will be renamed under the Safeway moniker.

Photo: Panoramic InterestsPatrick Kennedy, the owner of the development company Panoramic Interests, thinks he has a partial solution to the Bay Area's chronic homelessness problem and invites Berkeley to take a look at that solution in the form of a prototype currently installed next to City Hall.\nThe prefabricated MicroPAD -- a fully furnished, 20' by 8' foot steel box, reminiscent of a shipping container -- is designed to house one person, or possibly a couple. Stack many of them on top of each other, and they become a building of small housing units.\nThe MicroPAD prototype -- PAD stands for prefab affordable dwelling -- arrived on Tuesday and, even before it had been removed from the trailer on which had been brought over from San Francisco, it was already generating interest from passers-by, with some climbing up to peek through the unit's window.\nRead more about homelessness in Berkeley.\nKennedy is hoping to build these micro-housing buildings in Berkeley and Oakland, with an overall goal of providing housing for 5,000 Bay Area homeless people in the next five years. He has also been talking to city officials about the concept in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\"Homelessness has reached a boiling point, and it's going to get worse,\" he said last week at his San Francisco office. This is a way of creating fast and effective permanent housing for people without homes, he said. \"And many people are just one paycheck away from being homeless.\"\nThe micro units designed for homeless people are built in China as a pair of fully furnished modular units with corridor space in the middle. Rendering: Panoramic InterestsThe City Council is scheduled to discuss the idea of small, stackable housing units at its Jan. 24 meeting as Councilmembers Ben Bartlett and Linda Maio have an item on the agenda about micro-units. The item recommends that the city identify public land where such housing could be erected, obtain zoning and permitting approval for a 4-story, 100-unit building, identify a housing nonprofit to manage and operate the property, and establish criteria to determine who would be eligible to live there.\nBartlett said the item was inspired by Kennedy's model, but not written for him.\n\"I ran across micro-units about a year ago and I was really excited,\" he said. \"Having people on the street is a huge concern for me and my constituents. The waiting time for housing for many of the homeless is over a decade and the funding sources for supportive housing is drying up. This could be a way to build housing rapidly and cheaply -- it looks like a silver bullet.\"\nInside a MicroPAD\nEach unit has its own front door and large window (those positioned on the side of a building have two). There's a mud-room area to hang clothes that includes a bench on which to sit when taking off shoes. Every unit has a fridge-freezer, a sink and a combination oven-microwave. A day bed has storage underneath, as well as a 'black light' which is said to destroy bed bugs. A micro closet can hold clothes, and a separate closet is for a broom and cleaning products. The unit is designed with 24/7 ventilation and has pet-friendly surfaces. An opaque curved glass wall defines the private bathroom with a shower and toilet, grab rails, hooks and decorative blue nighttime lighting. Drainage in the bathroom allows the whole unit to be hosed down if needed.\nKennedy estimates it would cost Panoramic between $20-$25 million to build a 4-story, 100-unit micro-housing unit, depending on factors like access, traffic control and infrastructure. His proposal would see the city giving him the air rights to a public property, he would finance the development, and he would charge $1,000 per unit per month. A housing nonprofit would oversee the day-to-day management of the building, while Panoramic would handle structural maintenance.\nKennedy is actively looking for sites in the East Bay on which to build the micro housing. He says the former Berkeley High tennis courts, now a parking lot, would be an ideal spot for a micro-unit building. It could house teaching assistants and janitors, as well as those who have no homes, he said. He has not had any official talks with BUSD yet about the idea. Another possible location is the Berkeley Way parking lot downtown. One of the features of Panoramic's designs is that parking can be incorporated by placing the units on a bridge-like concrete platform so that parking is preserved at the street level. At the Berkeley High tennis court site, for example, Kennedy said he could put 80% of the existing parking back, with a 7-story, 300-400 housing unit building above it. Large-footprint parking lots in the centers of cities are an inefficient use of urban space, Kennedy argues.\nHe also said the rear of the main Berkeley Post Office at 2000 Alston Way -- a contentious site due to stiff local resistance to its proposed sale -- would be ideal. Kennedy would foresee keeping the historic front of the building, and using the warehouse space in back for housing. However, even the nondescript back of the post office has been registered as a National Historic Landmark, which may make that move difficult, if not impossible.\nView of the bed, desk and shelving and bathroom in a MicroPAD. Photo: Panoramic InterestsKennedy, a veteran developer who has built apartment buildings in Berkeley, currently has two ongoing projects in the city, both of which are built using his small-unit CitySpaces model designed for high-density sites (MicroPADs are an offshoot of CitySpaces). They are expected to be completed by spring 2019. The 4-story building at 2711 Shattuck Ave. will be all studios, while the Nexus Building at 2539 Telegraph will be a combination of studios and 2- and 4-bedroom apartments.\nThe Panoramic high-rise on Mission Street in San Francisco where Panoramic Interests has its offices was built using the CitySpaces design. The building's units are leased by both the California College of the Arts and the San Francisco Conservatory of Music for student accommodation. California College of the Arts also leases another recently built Panoramic micro-unit building at 38 Harriet St. in San Francisco. According to Kennedy, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music saw a roughly 40% increase in enrollment from accepted students in 2016, the first year after it started providing student housing in the Panoramic. \"Other factors certainly affected this as well -- changes in curriculum, new faculty, etc. -- but housing, I was told, was a big factor,\" Kennedy said.\nKennedy's proposal to build micro-units for the homeless in San Francisco hit a stumbling block, however. The fact the units are made overseas, in China, and not by U.S. unionized labor, was a deal breaker, and the city said there were already too many demands being made on scarce public property.\nKennedy said there are no American companies making the fully kitted-out modular units like the ones he is proposing for the Bay Area, which meet or exceed all local seismic building requirements. The company he works with in China also makes shipping containers. But he said 66% of the project costs are related to the on-site buildout and he is committed to using union labor for that in Berkeley. He has joined forces with Berkeley architect David Trachtenberg to design the buildings locally.\nThe prototype MicroPAD on a trailer soon after arriving outside Berkeley City Hall on Tuesday, Jan. 17. The unit will be open to the public through Jan. 24. Photo: Tracey TaylorBerkeley's new mayor, Jesse Arreguin, has made homelessness one of his top priorities since taking office, although historically he has been more circumspect about approving new developments in the city than his predecessor, Tom Bates. Arreguin had not responded to a request for comment by press time.\nKennedy said he is aware his proposals will be met with scrutiny, and perhaps resistance, in Berkeley, but he believes there is an urgency to address the ongoing housing crisis. He also advocates that the housing be considered and funded at the county, rather than city level.\n\"Paying for housing city by city is problematic,\" he said. \"Why should Berkeley fund it all? Homeless people are not citizens of any city. It would make sense for the county, or even the state to fund it, to spread the burden, use some creative financing.\"\nOne member of the homeless community has already expressed skepticism about the modular housing. Mike Zint, the founder of First They Came for the Homeless, said one of his friends said he had seen the MicroPAD and it did not look very well built.\nZint and others are advocates of building 'tiny homes,' essentially one-room homes on wheels. Mike Lee, another homeless advocate, said he thinks the tiny homes can be built for $10,000 each. Young people at Youth Spirit Artworks have been working designing these homes, according to Sally Hindman, its executive director.  She has put out a call to the community asking for vacant space onto which to place the houses.\nThe MicroPAD development would allow more people to be housed in a smaller area than tiny homes.\nIf the MicroPAD idea moves forward, Bartlett said he could foresee a homeless tenant paying a third of the $1,000 rent, with foundations or charities paying a third, and the city paying the final third -- \"we would provide the back stop,\" he said.\nPanoramic Interests' MicroPAD, designed to house a homeless person, is currently open to the public through Jan. 24 at the corner of Allston Way and Milvia Street, opposite Berkeley High School.

Gamelan swiftly spread to the villages, and is now common entertainment for both rituals and celebrations, often accompanied with dance or shadow puppetry. The rhythm, energy, and stories presented through gamelan vary immensely depending on the region, and they reflect differing religions and local legends. In that way it always feels fresh and dynamic.\nAn instrument called a 'bonang'. Photo: Melati CitrawirejaIn Berkeley, gamelan continues to take on new forms. GSJ was started in 1979 thanks to a small group of Indonesian and American enthusiasts and, as the first community-based Balinese gamelan group in the US, quickly became recognized across the country for its dedicated, vanguard work. It now offers gamelan and dance classes to the public, hosts rotating resident artists from Bali - next year it will welcome an accomplished mask dancer - and performs around the Bay Area and beyond, occasionally even returning to Bali. Scan the GSJ calendar to see if there's a performance near you.\n\nOn first meeting Susilo at the company studio she hugs me and offers tea. She's in her mid-40s, tall, with sparkly eyes set above high cheekbones and dark hair pulled into a loose bun. She calmly floats around the space - boiling water, pulling out cushions for us to sit on. It seems that dance influences her everyday movements too.\nThe main room has long mirrors and several large shelves filled with brightly painted gamelan instruments, tuned to specific seven-tone scales. Some are made of brass or bronze - like the metallophones and heavy gongs - while others are just wood and bamboo, including the tingklik, a set of hollowed bamboo tubes tied to a small frame.\n\"Bamboo is so much more affordable. So tingklik has a village feel,\" says Susilo, tapping the instrument with her fingernail to demonstrate its soft, twinkly ping.\nSusilo was reared on gamelan. Her father was the first Javanese gamelan teacher to come to the US, and her Japanese-American mother was a devoted Javanese dancer. After studying gamelan at UC Berkeley, Susilo moved to Bali for a year and continued to learn the dramatic and communicative nature of Balinese performance art. She now keeps toes in both the US and Bali, and has since married a distinguished gamelan choreographer, Bapak I Dewa Putu Berata (or most days just Pak Dewa), together establishing a Bali-based school and dance company called Cudamani. She's been involved with GSJ since 1991 and took the role of company director in 2011, where Pak Dewa and her two offspring now also practice and teach.\n\"Learning to be with 40 people and all breathe together, and feel something together ... [it has] profound and philosophical meaning because it's really about who we are as people and how much we depend on one another,\" Susilo says.\nAmia Eka, daughter of an ensemble member, tries on a sarong.

Photo: Melati CitrawirejaThe company remains rooted in traditional Balinese legends and wisdom, welcoming its virtuosity and rhythmic complexity, while still finding ways to push the envelope. Staying dedicated to the customs of this music and dance \"does not preclude you also being a creative innovative artist ... I think that kind of openness and rootedness are what make this music very powerful and vibrant even today,\" says Susilo.\n\"One day you can be playing a temple ceremony - really old pieces that are anonymously composed, passed down from your grandparents - and the next day literally be playing some crazy contemporary piece with some weird time signature ... and it's not at all in conflict with the individual, or the ensemble, or community.\"\nIn both dance and in life, finding and promoting positivity - especially in the local community - is essential for Susilo. Growing up, she was often the only Indonesian-American child in school. Today there is still a general lack of exposure to Indonesian culture in the US and Susilo hopes GSJ plays a part in dispelling animosity. The company makes sure to promote consistent activity outside of rehearsal, like visiting local elementary schools or throwing parties with free performances and Indonesian food. In Bali they call this a pasar feeling (pasar translates to 'market'), the idea of being a central locus for community interaction.\n\"I have to believe that every person we meet, or talk to, or touch, or sees our performances, or has some interaction - that we can bring something positive to them so they walk away feeling good about this place and our culture ... part of my life's work is to help people see the beautiful things about this place - the diversity of cultures. It's not one culture, not one religion.\"\nNia Vitale at dance rehearsal. Photo: Melati CitrawirejaA recent GSJ performance told a beautiful, haunting story set in Petulu, a small village in Bali. After enduring a string of tragic massacres in the 1960s, the village elders resolved to carry out a ceremony to bring balance back to the deeply unsettled community. On the evening of the ceremony a white egret visited the priest's house, the next day one appeared at the temple. After this - as the story goes - Petulu became the nightly roosting place for thousands of the elegant white birds. To this day they don't sleep anywhere else.\n\"Some say they're the spirits of those who passed away. Some say they're a blessing from the gods and a gift to the village who were trying to create harmony amidst a very chaotic situation ... because of course now a ton of people can make their living from people who go there,\" says Susilo, taking a sip of tea, a strip of sunlight inching along the carpet to our toes.\n\"It was a beautiful story to me because a village of elders and priests ... came together and were able to acknowledge there was really a lot of discord and imbalance ... and found a way to create equilibrium again and to bring harmony back into their life ... That kind of wisdom and inspiration can be so powerful and so healing for a community and doesn't rely on access to education, or money, or international aid.\"\nThe following week I drop in on a rehearsal, curious to see this kind of storytelling in progress. While their parents are busy practicing, the kids learn how to tie their sarongs and try out dance moves, the blue fabric dragging like tails on the floor behind them. Every now and then Susilo stops to tousle their hair and exclaim at how quickly they've grown.\n\"You're going to be a great dancer, just like your mom,\" Susilo says to little Amia Eka. These children have the special treat of growing up in a community steeped in both old wisdom and new ideas - what they will do with this opportunity is still a wonderful mystery. In an interview last year, Susilo said, \"When we give generously and lovingly to our students, we create a kindness that will not only benefit us, but our children and grandchildren.\"\nIt is with this consideration that Susilo dances through life in a way that is deeply meaningful to herself, and respectful of those who came before and who will continue after her.\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "In Berkeley: A dance company rooted in traditional Balinese legends and wisdom", "Tags": "['Dance in Berkeley']", "Sections": "['Community', 'Community']", "Natural Language Location": "Gamelan Sekar Jaya", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.854274", "Zip Code": "94705", "ID": "252044", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.268267", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/04/11/berkeley-dance-company-rooted-traditional-balinese-legends-wisdom/", "Author": "Melati Citrawireja", "Date": "2017-04-11T12:14:43-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "This large sinkhole caused the closure of the westbound lane of Tunnel Road in Berkeley.

Photo: Tracey TaylorThe first women's mosque in Northern California opened today in Berkeley with a dedication ceremony and prayers at its home at Starr King School for the Ministry, a graduate school and Unitarian Universalist seminary on LeConte Avenue.\nPerhaps fittingly for a place of worship that is breaking with tradition, its founder is not a faith leader but an activist.\nRabi'a Keeble, who describes herself as a writer, speaker and poet, as well as an activist, says it is time for Muslim women to step up and challenge the patriarchal norms of the Islam faith.\n\"Just like Rosa Parks said she couldn't take one more day on the back of the bus, we need to bring women's lib to Muslim women,\" said Keeble, who lives in Oakland.\n\nQal'bu Maryam (Maryam's Heart, or the heart of Mary, Jesus' mother) is designed to provide Muslim women with \"a rich and open Islamic educational environment.\" It is the first women's mosque in Northern California and only the second in the U.S. -- the first opened in Los Angeles in 2015.\nThe women-led mosque will welcome everyone, not just women, according to Keeble: new converts, lifelong Muslims, non-Muslims, people of all genders and of all colors. And unlike at many other mosques, there will be no segregation by gender at Qal'bu Maryam. Women may lead prayers, and everyone prays together.\nRabi'a Keeble, founder of Berkeley's new women's mosque, speaks at its opening dedication on Friday, April 14. Photo: Tracey TaylorKeeble, who converted to Islam 13 years ago, said the idea for the new mosque was born from her frustration with the way women are separated from men in most mosques, how they are expected to behave, and how they are patronized by imams, the mosque's prayer leaders.\n\"For 13 years I have sat in separate rooms with no windows, often with no means of seeing the imam,\" she told Berkeleyside. \"I have had enough of the idea that men are God-like and that they make decision about my life as a female Muslim -- women are policed and judged and denied certain rights.\"\nKeeble cites examples of prohibitions such as associating with men, wearing make-up, which she does, and even plucking one's eyebrows.\nShe points to the role of a mosque and its leader in supporting the community it serves, but feels that many imams are ill-equipped to play that role.\n\"Lots of imams come from small villages and are not educated,\" she said. \"They recite the Quran and can read Arabic, but they don't necessarily have the skills in dealing with broad aspects of society.\"\nSome imams won't even look her in the face, she added, speculating they are afraid.\nSome 50 people attended the opening of the new women's mosque at the Starr King School for the Ministry in Berkeley on April 14. Photo: Tracey TaylorKeeble, a graduate of Starr King and Graduate Theological Union, stresses that she is not against the Islam faith. Indeed she converted after being raised \"nominally Christian,\" because, she says, Islam appealed to all her senses, spiritually and to her soul.\n\"It is a beautiful religion,\" she said, \"And a faith that I can embody.\"\nRather, it is a case of making the faith applicable to contemporary life in 2017, she said, and of Muslim men and women worshiping and learning as equals.\nAt the dedication ceremony, attended by around 50 people, Keeble spoke of women's central place in the Islam faith and the new mosque's mission.\n\"Qal'bu Maryam will recenter and refocus on what our faith already embraces but has been obstructed by patriarchy,\" she said. \"This is a mosque where women will find their place in the world and worship together.\"\nKeeble admits that when she first conceived of the women's mosque, she thought it should be exclusively for women. But she was persuaded that closing it up in that way would be acting just like the exclusionary patriarchy she is challenging.\nThe entrance to the new women's mosque at 2441 LeConte Ave. in Berkeley. Photo: Tracey TaylorActivism will be integral to the new mosque which is slated to focus on social justice and education. \"We want to inspire a new generation to take roles as leaders and educators,\" Keeble said Friday.\nKeeble's own activist roots include a campaign she led, in 2015, to boycott a Whole Foods in Oakland after a security guard beat up an African-American customer. She also took on the grocery chain over the fact that its security guards carried guns.\nSpeaking at the opening, Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin welcomed the mosque to the city's spiritual community and said it was particularly good to have such an \"all-inclusive\" place of worship in the current political climate. (Berkeley is also home to America's first accredited Muslim institution of higher learning, after the opening of Zaytuna College, in 2010.)\nHis sentiments were echoed by Soraya Deenf, founder of the Muslim Women Speakers Movement, who delivered the first sermon at the mosque.\nShe said the opening of Qal'bu Maryam came at \"a time in America when Muslims are accused of every act of terrorism and our patriotism is being questioned.\"\nDeenf, who was born in Sri Lanka, doesn't read Arabic or wear the hijab, joked about being seen as a \"bad Muslim,\" and also spoke of her realization at the age of 12 that she was not welcome at a local mosque.\nAttendees at the opening dedication of the Qal'bu Maryam mosque greet each other. Photo: Tracey Taylor\"I was told I couldn't go there because I was a girl and I couldn't show my hair and I couldn't speak,\" she said. \"Now I stand for all the women who have been dismissed and all the men's voices who have been discarded.\"\nDeenf said that \"women and religion have always collided,\" and that it was time to \"set a human example, of kindness, community and love.\"\n\"Evil prevails when good people do nothing,\" she said, paraphrasing Edmund Burke.\n\nThe fireside room at Starr King, home of the new women's mosque. Photo: Tracey TaylorKeeble hopes that the new mosque will draw Muslims from all backgrounds. She describes the mosques where she worships in the East Bay, for example, as having congregations that largely reflect cultural or national roots. While she understands the motivation -- shared norms, food and so on -- she feels a blending of different heritages and opinions would be more productive.\n\"A mosque should be a crucible to work out issues around gender and racism and differences,\" she said.\nIn that vein, the group that worked with Keeble on the launch of the new women's mosque included Jewish women and two men.\nQal'bu Maryam will hold services every Friday at 12:30 p.m. and, Keeble says, she is actively looking to recruit a female imam. Down the line she would also like to be able to declare the new place of worship a sanctuary mosque for people who are being targeted by immigration officials.\n\"There is no point in having a faith-based institution that doesn't care about its community,\" she said -- \"making sure they have houses and are fed.\"\nAnd, at the opening of the new mosque, Keeble demonstrated her commitment to making everyone feel welcome. When it came time for prayers, she announced that accommodations had been made for anyone -- men or women -- who wanted to pray separately from each other.\n\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "A women's mosque opens in Berkeley, only second in the United States", "Tags": "[\"Qal'bu Maryam Mosque\"]", "Sections": "['Community', 'Community']", "Natural Language Location": "Starr King School for the Ministry", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8770151", "Zip Code": "94709", "ID": "254453", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2640475", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/04/14/womens-mosque-opens-berkeley-second-united-states/", "Author": "Tracey Taylor", "Date": "2017-04-14T16:46:14-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "\nKnow where this is?

He spent a lot of time in People's Park where he could be seen smoking his ubiquitous Virginia Slims cigarettes and clutching a cup of coffee with lots of sugar. He eschewed the free food distributed at the park and preferred to salvage for his meals in dumpsters because, as he told the San Francisco Chronicle, \"It makes your immune system strong.\" He did not drink or do drugs.\n\n\"I'm addicted to it,\" Hate said of the homeless life in an interview with the East Bay Express. \"It's fresh air.

Photo: Ted FriedmanBut Hate Man grew tired of the conventional 9-to-5 life and moved to the Bay Area in 1973. For about 13 years he lived in a studio near Telegraph Avenue. During this time he adopted his philosophy of \"oppositionality.\" He believed people would feel safe together if they rubbed one another the wrong way first. He started telling people \"I hate you\" as a greeting, or knocked up against them, either with a fist bump or a shoulder bump. Hate Man stood in an empty fountain on Sproul Plaza the first year of his \"preaching,\" according to the Express.\n\"For me to trust a person and be comfortable with them, they have to be willing to say 'I hate you,'\" Hawthorne told the Mercury News.\nHate Man is featured in a mural at People's Park drawn by Bruce Duncan, Ace Backword, and other volunteers.Hate Man was famous enough that he had a Wikipedia entry that explained his philosophy this way: \"The idea is to avoid negative conflict by bringing such differences out in the open, rather than creating situations where people rob or con one another for what they want.\" CBS News did a segment on him in 1997, and there were numerous newspaper articles written about him. His former employer, the New York Times, ran a column about him in 1991. He is also depicted in a mural at People's Park.\nHate Man had been suffering from heart problems this year, according to Sally Hindman, director of Youth Spirit Artworks. He had been hospitalized three times and had heart surgery, she said. His heart apparently gave out Sunday evening.\nAs evidenced by the accolades pouring in, Hate Man was a beloved figure in Berkeley.\n\"Hate Man.. you will always be an utter Berkeley treasure,\" Hindman wrote on Facebook. \"Sooooo many of us will miss you absolutely hugely, when we go up to People's Park, or to Sproul Plaza, or just when we think of you.. but we will think of you & it will bring giant smiles to our faces.

We have some awesome pools here. Here's my roundup so far, after trying most of the pools in and around Berkeley:\nThe Richmond Plunge in Richmond, pictured top (hours and info). $5 for a day pass. This is as good as it gets -- the cathedral of Bay Area swimming pools. Built in 1926, this community 'natatorium' was renovated and reopened in 2010 after several decades of decay. Everything about the place is awesome, and the staff is friendly too. The entire building is original, with great period details. Light streams in through greenhouse-type ceiling windows, and vintage steel and shiplap are everywhere. The pool itself (with its new saline chlorination system) is excellent, and even the locker rooms, while small, are clean and full of character. BYO towel and lock. Located in the historic Point Richmond district. For more info, check out The Plunge's Wikipedia page, and read what the New York Times said about it. (As a bonus for railfans, the Plunge is adjacent to a historic depot, two rare 'wig-wag' train signals, and regular yard activity by BNSF locomotives).\nHearst North Pool. Photo: Cal RecHearst North Pool on the Cal campus in Berkeley (hours and info). $20 for a day pass, or join Berkeley Rec Sports for $65/month. If Richmond Plunge is the cathedral, this is the Roman amphitheater of Bay Area swimming. Built in the 1920s, and designed by famous architect Julia Morgan, this pool is designed to make you feel like a god. With its rich marble-lined pool and deck, urns, statues, Corinthian columns, and stunning view of the Berkeley Campanile and beyond, Hearst North is a magical place. The lanes are wide and the water is great! This pool is 33 yards long instead of the normal 25... again, larger than life. The swimmers are mostly students -- and friendly. Towels provided, but BYO lock. See these great historic photos of the Hearst North pool. Read what Hannah at 40 Pools thought about it. And finally, check out this heartwarming Berkeleyside profile of a longtime Hearst North swimmer and friend of the lifeguards.\nAlbany Aquatic Center. Photo: LP Consulting Engineers Inc.Albany Aquatic Center in Albany (hours and info). $6 for a day pass. Attached to Albany High and located next to a beautiful city park with easy parking, this is one of the nicest municipal pools I've ever visited. The locker rooms are small and nothing to write home about, and the indoor pool is just ok, but the outdoor pool is a gem, with clean clear water, fantastic light, and views of the East Bay Hills. The swimmers are mostly local regulars (including some students and teachers, and masters swimmers), and friendly, and it's never overcrowded. As a bonus, you occasionally get to hear the Albany High School morning announcements over the loudspeaker! BYO towel and lock.\n\nSpieker pool. Photo: Cal BearsSpieker Pool on the Cal campus in Berkeley (hours and info). $20 for a day pass, or join Berkeley Rec Sports for $65/month. This is a big outdoor pool with clear cool water and few amenities, located three blocks from the Hearst Pool. Not generally open for morning lap swims, this is a pool for later in the day. Attached to the Cal Recreational Sports Facility which has workout machines, classes, etc. Some towels available, BYO lock. Here's the 40 Pools review... she thought it was just ok, and I agree, despite hosting so many Olympic swimmers over the years.\nCity Club pool. Photo: Berkeley City ClubBerkeley City Club Pool, Berkeley (info). Must be a member (pricey) or hotel guest to swim there. This is another of the big Julia Morgan designed pool-stravaganzas (along with Hearst North, and the San Simeon Hearst Castle Pools). Actually she designed this whole iconic building which was a posh civic club but is now a bit run down. I've been inside this indoor pool and the locker room, but haven't swum here. The locker rooms seem dingy, and the pool area itself a little humid. I imagine the water is warm and chlorinated. But oh, the decorative tile!\nEl Cerrito pool. Photo: Google MapsEl Cerrito Swim Center, El Cerrito (hours and info) $5 for a day pass. Discovered this one on Thanksgiving, because it was open (a rarity -- even the nearby Albany Aquatic Center wasn't). Huge outdoor pool, friendly staff, basic locker room, BYO towel and lock. Water was clear and cool-ish. Big parking lot, right next to a huge PG&E substation. Otherwise undistinguished. Named after one of the pool's longtime lifeguards, Emery G. Weed. Also has a \"splash park\" for kids.\nKing Pool. Photo: Berrin YMartin Luther King Pool, Berkeley. (hours and info) $6 for a day pass, and you need exact change. Attached to MLK Middle School, this pool will bring you right back to summer day camp. There's just something about mildewy/scary locker rooms plus fresh air under the pines (Eucalyptus in this case), and an over-chlorinated pool with staff so attentive they're camp counselor-esque ('why don't you share lane three with Bob... Jenny's about to finish up'). Once you're in the pool, its actually really nice and gets great morning light. The showers have mystery sensors which make them go on and off randomly. I wouldn't make this my regular pool (though many locals do), but it's a fine back-up.\nBerkeley YMCA pool. Photo: YMCABerkeley YMCA, Berkeley (hours and info). Must be a member, but you can get one free guest pass, no questions asked, with photo ID. This is a pretty straightforward urban Y indoor pool, with locker rooms perpetually being renovated, and water that's clean one day and cloudy another (it was good the last time I went). Good camaraderie in the locker room. This pool is located in downtown Berkeley, right near BART, but if you walk a few extra blocks you can swim in one of the nearby (and superior) outdoor Cal pools (Hearst or Spieker), see above. Update: newly renovated sauna in the men's locker room is pretty nice.\nStrawberry Canyon Pool. Photo: Citizen reporterUC Strawberry Canyon Pool, Berkeley. (hours and info) This Z-shaped outdoor pool is only open in the summer, and you need the Cal Rec day pass or a separate $10 Strawberry Canyon Rec pass. I swam here once many years ago and remembered liking it. It's up in the hills and I recall some nice views and fresh air. Hannah at 40 Pools did a review, found it welcoming but also said the water was a little warm.\nUC Golden Bears pool. Photo: Cal BearsUC Golden Bear Pool, Berkeley (hours and info) $10 for a day pass, or join Berkeley Rec Sports for $65/month. Haven't swum here yet, but it seems to ofter morning and afternoon lap swim on alternating days. It's at UC Berkeley's Clark Kerr campus a little south of main campus. Clark Kerr was the president of UC during the Free Speech Movement in 1964 and he tried to steer a middle course between the demands of the students and the demands of newly elected Governor Ronald Reagan. The UC Board of Regents fired Kerr in 1967. But they named a campus for him anyway!\n\nUC Legends Aquatic Center, Berkeley. This is the promised land of East Bay lap pools, an unattainable nirvana. You can't swim here and neither can I. Unless you happen to be on Cal's varsity swimming or diving teams. Built at a cost of $18 million (private donations) and opened in November 2016, this pool looks sparkly and beautiful through the fence from Bancroft street. You can see it, hear it, smell it, almost taste it. But they have no plans to offer rec swimming hours... doh! I snuck inside and took this video of the team practicing, but it was too dark and doesn't do justice to the pool's stunning allure. Go see for yourself.\nTemescal pool. Photo: 40 PoolsTemescal Pool, Oakland (hours and info) $6 lap swim fee. 33-yard salt-water pool. Haven't been here yet, but Hannah at 40 Pools really liked it. Will add more color after I visit!\nMills College pool. Photo: Mills CollegeMills College Trefethen Pool, Oakland (hours and info) $7 day pass. I've heard good things about this pool, but haven't tried it yet... stay tuned.\nKnow a pool I missed that's worth checking out?

Photo: Courtesy Nancy RubinInternational Women's Day on March 8, part of Women's History Month, has taken on an added significance this year as it has been harnessed by groups nationwide as a way of showing resistance to President Trump and his policies and attitudes towards women.\nThe Women's March organization, which spearheaded the biggest protest the country has ever seen the day after Trump's inauguration, is calling for women to strike on Wednesday to show the world what it is like to have #ADayWithoutWomen (in the same spirit as #ADayWithoutImmigrants on Feb. 16). The organization also recommends avoiding shopping for the day (with exceptions for small, women- and minority-owned businesses), and to wear red to show solidarity.\nIn Berkeley, International Women's Day has deep historical roots, specifically within the public school system. BUSD used to celebrate International Women's Day as a district-wide holiday and Berkeley High School was the first high school in the country to have a Women's Studies department. Many of the city's schools have planned events for Wednesday -- scroll down to see a list.\nFor local resident Susan Groves, the day has particular resonance as she was instrumental in launching the Women's Studies program at Berkeley High and incorporating women into the curriculum across the district. Groves went into teaching as a mission rather than a career, she told Berkeleyside, after earning her graduate degree at Cal. She worked within Oakland Unified before becoming a history teacher at Berkeley High, all the while being politically engaged in both the civil-rights' and women's movements in the 1960s and 1970s. Groves said strides had been made with civil rights in the school district, with African-Americans running for the School Board and the establishment of the Martin Luther King holiday. But, despite the work of the National Organization for Women (NOW) and the women's consciousness movement, \"there was nothing statistically about how girls were being treated within schools.\"\n\nIn addition, the curriculum was heavily skewed towards men and gender stereotypes. \"You would go into history class and assign students to write biographies about ten historical figures and they would all choose men -- probably all white men,\" said Groves. The school library had few books by women, and the first-grade classroom would still be basing its learning on the \"Dick and Jane-style\" nuclear family, she added.\nThe then BUSD Superintendent Richard Foster agreed to allow the formation of a Women's Task Force, led by Groves, to study the issue and make recommendations. The result was an overhauled curriculum -- which included units, said Groves, such as \"Black women poets\" for fourth graders, and carpentry for girls and knitting for boys in third grade -- and the launch, in 1972, of the country's first high-school Women's Studies program.\nThree friends who were instrumental in launching the pioneering Women's Studies program at Berkeley High: (l to r): Susan Groves, Kuniko Soga and Lyn Reese. Photo: Nancy RubinThe task force also recommended that BUSD institute a holiday in recognition of women, and the result was the Susan B. Anthony Day in February. However the holiday quickly ran into opposition, Groves recalled, not least among women, who complained about the inconvenience of having to find childcare for another day when children weren't at school.\n\"There was also opposition because, although our curriculum was now multicultural, the holiday was celebrating another another white woman,\" said Groves.\nThe next year the switch was made to celebrating International Women's Day in March. The holiday has its roots in the socialist movement and, in particular, in the textile industry in New York. The earliest Women's Day observance was held on Feb. 28, 1909, in New York and organized by the Socialist Party of America.\nThe Women's Studies program at Berkeley High was disbanded in 1979, and Groves went back to the history department where she continued to teach a women's students unit. She remembers the class as being transformational for many of the students who took it. She recalls in particular a trip the students took to the United Nation's World Congress on Women in Beijing in 1995.\n\"They saw Hillary Clinton and heard from Aung San Suu Kyi,\" she said. \"This was formative for many young women in the Bay Area who met young women from all around the world while they were there. It was spectacular.\"\nBefore moves were made to change it in the 1970s, the BUSD curriculum was heavily skewed towards men and gender stereotypes, said Susan Groves who was instrumental in changing it.

Drayton was particularly keen to help because Hurlimann was an older cyclist and through his stores he caters to \"four generations of cyclists,\" including kids and seniors. \"Other bike shops often ignore those populations,\" he said.\nHe made the bike specifically for the memorial from scratch.\n\"Two hours before we took it there it didn't exist,\" Drayton said. He didn't use any valuable parts for fear they would be stolen. Dave Campbell of Bike East Bay added the flowers at the back of the bike.\nThe shelf-life of a ghost bike varies, Drayton said.\n\"They wear out their welcome or become discarded, either stolen or removed by the city,\" he said, adding that he is keeping an eye on it and making sure it is in good shape.\n\"The memorial is an impressive testament to people caring for someone that most of them did not know personally,\" reader Lea Delson wrote Berkeleyside. Hurlimann is not believed to have had any immediate family or close relatives left when he died. Delson said she believed one neighbor had taken on the task of maintaining the memorial.\nFuneral mass for Joseph Hurlimann: A funeral mass will be offered at St. Joseph the Worker Church for its longtime parishioner, Joseph Hurlimann, on Thursday, March 9, at 10:30 a.m. There will be a short viewing of the body at 10 a.m. prior to mass. Afterward there will be a gravesite committal service at St. Joseph Cemetery in San Pablo. All friends and fellow parishioners of \"Joe\" are welcome to join.\nFlowers and fruit are part of the memorial for Joe Hurlimann on Sacramento Street.

Photo: Courtesy of family\nBette Kroening, the smiling, ever-present co-founder of Bette's Oceanview Diner in Berkeley, food pioneer and cookbook author, died on Thursday Feb. 16, 2017 from cancer. She was 71.\nA native of New York City, Bette Louise Caminez was born at the French Hospital in New York City on Oct. 15, 1945. Her parents, Louise (nee Schlosberg) Caminez, a special education teacher, and David Caminez, an accountant at General Motors, later moved the family to Teaneck, New Jersey, where she and her brother Jon grew up.\nFood -- especially of the European Jewish variety -- was a cornerstone of the Caminez family, and, from an early age, Bette loved to cook and eat. She had fond memories of her uncle Dick's roast chicken, which she would devour during her summers at Queen Lake Camp, an all-girls sleep-away camp run by her family in central Massachusetts. Before she was old enough to be a camper, her parents would keep her busy by setting her on the kitchen counter and letting her watch Mario and Albert, the cooks, at work.\nAfter completing a B.A. in English from the University of Pennsylvania, she married her college sweetheart, David Klein, and moved with him to southern California. She earned a masters degree in social work from the University of Southern California in 1969, and, in 1971, relocated to the Bay Area where she found work in the Contra Costa County Department of Social Services. She later worked at Children's Hospital in Oakland, where she helped develop the first NIMH training program to identify and treat child abuse and neglect.\nIn the mid-1970s, while between jobs, she began taking classes at Joyce Goldstein's California Street Cooking School, San Francisco's first international culinary training center.\nIt was a pivotal moment in American food. Shops and restaurants in Berkeley's so-called Gourmet Ghetto, like Peet's Coffee, Alice Waters's Chez Panisse, The Cheese Board and Cocolat were sowing the seeds of an American food revolution, and Bette felt a powerful attraction to their ethos of integrity in cooking and business.\nAt a party on New Year's Eve 1976, newly divorced, she met Manfred Kroening, a tool-and-die maker from Hamburg, Germany. Bette loved the way he told stories, enthusiastically and mostly with his hands to make up for his beginner's English. They became inseparable almost immediately, and moved to Hamburg in 1977, where Bette studied German and was introduced to Schinkenwurst.\nUpon returning to California, with encouragement from Manfred, Bette decided to pursue her interest in cooking. She found work in the catering kitchen of Narsai David, where she met Paul Bertolli. They would soon reconnect at Mark Miller's landmark Fourth Street Grill in Berkeley. Under Bertolli (who later opened Oliveto in Oakland and founded Fra' Mani Salumi), Bette became Fourth Street Grill's lunchtime kitchen manager. It was there that she hired another fledgling food pioneer, Sue Conley, founder of Cowgirl Creamery.\nFourth Street, located in the industrial district of Berkeley, was taking off as a commercial destination, and its developer, Denny Abrams, who happened to be the Kroenings' next-door neighbor in Oakland, was planning a second building across the street from the Fourth Street Grill. In a fateful conversation he told Bette that he was reserving a long, narrow space in the new building for a more affordable, everyday eatery.\nBette had happy childhood memories of meals and malts at diners up and down the East Coast, and the new space gave her an idea: what Berkeley needed was a warm, welcoming neighborhood diner with all the classic trimmings-- a linoleum counter, leatherette stools, plush, chrome-trimmed booths and a jukebox. But this would be a diner with a difference. Its menu of mainstays -- like pancakes, eggs, scrapple, sandwiches, pies and milkshakes -- would all be crafted from scratch from fresh, local ingredients in the spirit of the new style of California cooking.\nThe Kroenings invited Conley to join them as a business partner, and, on April 5, 1982, they opened Bette's Oceanview Diner, with Bette and Sue running the kitchen and Manfred as host and barista. The words, \"Good Food. Fast, Friendly Service.\" were painted across the front window. But Bette's insistence on careful technique without shortcuts -- eggs gently soft-scrambled for several minutes, custardy omelets made in French cast-iron pans -- was at odds with the pace of short-order cooking. This was slow food decades before its time, and in the early days, customers would often experience long waits for their food. Rather than compromise her culinary standards, Bette simply had the word \"fast\" scraped off of the window. \"Good Food, Friendly Service\" remains the diner's slogan to this day, and 35 years later, the line that forms out front is proof that its loyal customers are willing to wait -- sometimes up to two hours on weekends -- for a good, honest meal.\nBette's Oceanview Diner: its retro design is married to a commitment to thoughtfully prepared food. Photo: Bette's Oceanview Diner\nThat idea resonated all over America, and Bette's is now recognized as one of the first entries in an American diner renaissance that would blend retro design with updated, thoughtfully prepared food.\nIn 1986, the partners added Bette's To Go, selling homemade pastries, pizza, sandwiches and salads to take away. They also launched a line of pancake and scone mixes, which led to a recipe book. Kroening, Conley and one of the diner's original cooks, Steve Siegelman, wrote The Pancake Handbook, which they self-published in 1991. In 1993, Berkeley's Ten Speed Press acquired the title. Now in its second edition, the book has remained in print for nearly 25 years.\nIn 1997, Bette's was featured in a detergent commercial, which earned substantial residuals for many of the staff. A longtime cook and a waiter made enough money to put down-payments on their first houses. This was the kind of success that gave Bette joy. She often said social work prepared her well for running a restaurant because she cared as much about community as cooking and was passionately committed to social justice in business.\nBette was an outspoken advocate for a $15 minimum wage, profit-sharing, paid vacations and health benefits, and that generosity is reflected in the loyalty of the diner's staff, a number of whom have worked at the restaurant for upwards of 20 and even 30 years. Bette was proud to have made the diner a place where people could envision having a career. At least five couples met and married while working there, and a dozen staff members became homeowners and raised their families in the neighborhood. As Bette said at a 2015 Berkeley City Council meeting on the city's minimum wage ordinance, \"We are nothing without the people who are our staff.\"\nBette will be remembered for her kindness and empathy, her ability to listen and connect, and her endless appetite for reading, learning, languages and lively conversation. When it came to food, she was unapologetically opinionated -- and generally correct. That integrity inspired a generation of cooks, staff, and friends. And it will continue to nourish countless happy customers at Bette's Diner with good, simple food done right.\nBette Kroening is survived by her husband, Manfred Kroening; her daughter, Lucie Kroening; a nephew Steven Caminez, his wife Yanyan Caminez, and their son Jonathan of Fremont; a niece, April Bentley, her husband Jim, and their children Emma and Christian of Tallahassee, Florida.\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Bette Kroening's honor may be made to the ACLU.\nDetails regarding a memorial will be posted at BettesDiner.com and on the diner's Facebook page.\nThis piece was written and shared with Berkeleyside by Bette Kroening's family.\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "Bette Kroening, co-founder of Bette's Oceanview Diner, has died", "Tags": "['Berkeley dining', 'Berkeley obituaries', \"Bette's Oceanview Diner\", 'Fourth Street Berkeley', 'West Berkeley']", "Sections": "['Community', 'Community', 'Nosh', 'Obituaries']", "Natural Language Location": "Bette's Oceanview Diner", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8698197", "Zip Code": "94710", "ID": "249361", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.3026592", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/23/bette-kroening-co-founder-bettes-oceanview-diner-berkeley-died/", "Author": "Guest contributor", "Date": "2017-02-23T20:28:43-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Water hyacinth and tule reeds in the East Bay water on Feb. 21.

Berkeley is a beacon for social justice\nBerkeley has been at the forefront of virtually every important social justice movement over the last half-century: Free Speech, Anti-War, Civil Rights, Disability Rights, and LGBTQ Rights. Where Berkeley leads, California follows. And where California goes, so goes the nation.\nThe Berkeley City Council is set to consider a ban on the sale of fur within city limits, most likely in a March council meeting. Passing the fur ban will solidify Berkeley's place at the frontier of social justice.\nThe animal-rights movement is quickly gaining momentum in this famously progressive California town. The new Berkeley Animal Rights Center serves as a hub for the growing number of animal-rights activists flocking to Berkeley.\nLast November, the Berkeley City Council passed the nation's first resolution supporting Chinese animal-rights activists fighting to end the dog meat trade in Yulin.\nAs they see pro-animal legislation in Berkeley, activists from across the state and the nation will be empowered to advocate for similar legislation in their respective municipalities. Some will be inspired to move to Berkeley, which will continue to light the path.\n2. Fur is a product of unspeakable cruelty and should be eradicated\nFur farm investigations have revealed animals spending their entire lives in tiny raised in small cages until they are killed by anal electrocution, gassed to death, or have their necks snapped. Fur-bearing animals trapped in the wild are cruelly separated from their families when they are caught in traps until they are shot.\nAlthough some contend (wrongly in my view) that animal-based foods are essential to human health or survival, no-one argues that a mink coat, for example, is anything but a fashion statement. Fur is a status symbol; by definition, a perceived visible, external badge of one's social position and perceived indicator of economic or social status.\nSince animals' fur is expensive and affordable to very few people, it doesn't have as much public support as other products of animal exploitation, such as meat and dairy. Fur is expensive, gratuitous, and completely unnecessary for our society. Taking animals' fur is one of the most trivial of reasons to hurt them.\nA chart showing estimated public support for animal exploitation compiled by the author, Orlando Torres, based on many years involved in the animal rights movement and on  input from animal-rights advocates.\n3. Fur is becoming increasingly controversial due to the \"humane myth\"\nAfter the City of West Hollywood passed a fur ban in 2011,  there was new hope for animals. Instead of focusing only on getting celebrities to raise anti-fur awareness, activists have taken protecting animals straight to lawmakers and courts. Following West Hollywood, Berkeley must help contain the unchecked growth of the fur industry whose targeted misinformation and falsehoods keep animals oppressed and separate them from their families for human profit and vanity.\nNew deceptive messaging by the fur industry encourages the idea that killing fur-bearing animals is somehow acceptable or humane or green. Perhaps these myths are what made global fur sales rise by 70% from 2000 to 2010. This trend needs to be stopped. As long as they are considered \"things\", animals will always be abused. And all the evidence shows that, despite what the fur industry claims, fur is not environmentally friendly, but is in fact between 3 and 10 times as environmentally devastating as fur-free alternatives.\nAs many recent investigations of animal farms have shown, even the most reputable \"cage-free\" and \"humane-certified\" facilities often turn out to be deplorable places of suffering. This helps illustrate the point that using and killing animals, treating them solely as property for personal gain rather than as sentient creatures, is virtually guaranteed to result in their misery.\nTo learn more about this important life-saving initiative, visit Fur Free Berkeley.\nWild coyote with his leg caught waiting to be shot in the head to be turned into an accessory on a $500 jacket.

Photo: California JapantownsIn 1914, five Japanese-American families -- the Fujiis, Kimbaras, Imamuras, Tsubamotos and Tokunagas -- banded together to open the University Laundry. Located on the corner of Shattuck and Blake, the University Laundry was a partnership of five smaller laundries. The families lived upstairs and shared a kitchen, dining room and living room, and worked on the ground floor.\nThe University Laundry was one of about 70 businesses located in Berkeley's thriving Japanese-American community before the outbreak of World War II. There were about 1,300 Japanese-Americans in the city, and the bulk of them lived in the southwest quadrant of Berkeley in a racially-mixed, affordable neighborhood.  It was a vibrant community, with its own newspaper, the Japanese Women's Herald, grocery stores, florists, boarding houses for students attending UC Berkeley, a number of churches, including the Free Methodist Church on Derby and the Higashi Honganji Buddhist Temple on Oregon Street.\nChiura Obata. Photo: Wikipedia/Creative CommonsOne of the most famous residents was artist Chiura Obata who began teaching at UC in 1932 and who had a studio on Telegraph Avenue. His wife, Haruko, taught ikebana, or flower arranging, in the building, and their son had a store selling Japanese art. Obata had designed the Oriental rooms for Gump and his paintings of Yosemite were internationally admired.\nAll this changed 75 years ago on February 19, 1942, when President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which ordered the internment of Japanese-Americans. Soon, Berkeley's thriving Japanese-American community was no more; its members were forced to abandon their houses and businesses and load up on buses where they were taken to internment camps around the West, like the Topaz War Relocation Center in Utah, or Manzanar in the eastern section of California or the Tanforan Racetrack, on the San Francisco peninsula.  For years they were forced to live in barren barracks in isolated regions of the country. When they were allowed to return, many of them were unable to recover their possession, homes, or companies.\n\nOrder for Japanese to relocate. Photo: Bancroft LibraryAs historian Charles Wollenberg writes for the Berkeley Public Library website, some Berkeley residents tried to fight the internments, to no avail. \"A small group of Berkeleyans formed the Fair Play Committee to protest the internment. Members included Harry Kingman of Stiles Hall, U.C. Economics Professor Paul Taylor, photographer Dorothea Lange and Pacific School of Religion faculty member Galen Fisher. Their protests hardly represented majority opinion in Berkeley, let alone the rest of the state, and they were unable to prevent the relocation. But the committee did maintain contacts with internees and monitor conditions at the camps. At the suggestion of Kingman and International House director Allen C. Blaisdell, UC President Robert Gordon Sproul called on the government to allow Japanese American students to finish their college educations.\"\nBerkeley's Japanese families were ordered to report to Pilgrim Hall in the First Congregational Church, according to Kenneth Stein, a past president of the Berkeley Historical Society. He sent the photo below.\n\"The ladies of the church provided the evacuees with tea and cookies in Pilgrim Hall, as one elderly church member recalled, 'to make the experience as warm and as friendly as possible,'\" according to Stein.\nAfter the war, Obata and his family, along with other Japanese families, did return to Berkeley, but their community was never as geographically connected as before.\nIn recent years, a number of steps have been taken to acknowledge the history of the Japanese and Japanese-Americans in Berkeley.\nA mural at 2518 Telegraph Ave. that commemorates the life and work of Chiura Obata. Photo: Berkeley Historical Plaque Project/Robert KehlmannObata's studio before his internment was at 2525 Telegraph Avenue (now a City of Berkeley landmark.)  A history written by Donna Graves for The Berkeley Historical Plaque Project provides this description:\n\"From 1939 to 1942, the Telegraph Avenue storefront hosted Obata's painting classes, art exhibits, and ikebana lessons by Obata's wife, Haruko, a prominent teacher of this traditional Japanese art of flower arranging. Their eldest son, Kimio, managed the studio and ran an art goods store in the space as well. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Berkeley's Japanese American community came under increased suspicion, and a gun was fired at the Obata Studio. Four months later the Obatas, along with 1,300 other Japanese Americans, were given ten days to prepare for \"evacuation\" from Berkeley. The family closed the Telegraph Avenue studio and had to sell their merchandise at a loss.\nWhile Obata was interned in San Bruno, he established an art school at this Assembly center. Some Berkeley residents provided Obata with art supplies for his students. This photograph shows part of the morning class learning freehand brush strokes. Photo: Department of the Interior/WikimediaWhile incarcerated, Chiura Obata founded art schools, first at the temporary Tanforan Assembly Center and later, in Topaz, Utah, at one of ten remote \"relocation centers\" operated by the War Relocation Authority. Obata encouraged his fellow \"internees\" to look to nature for strength during their unjust imprisonment. Sketches and paintings made throughout Obata's wartime experience provide crucial and poignant documentation of the process that forcibly relocated and imprisoned approximately 120,000 people, two-thirds of whom were United States citizens.\nThe Obatas returned to Berkeley in 1945, and Chiura resumed teaching at the University; they were not able to reopen the Telegraph Avenue studio and store.\"\nIn 2016, the Telegraph Avenue Business Improvement District commissioned a commemorative mural across the street from the painter's studio.\nThe Berkeley Historical Plaque Project has a plaque about Obata and about the commemorative mural.\nOn March 2, the Landmarks Preservation Commission will consider an application to declare the University Laundry building a city landmark, according to Steve Finacom, who submitted the application.\n\"The building is important not only because of its lengthy association with the University Laundry but because it's a rare early Berkeley commercial building, particularly on Shattuck south of Downtown,\" said Finacom. \"It dates to 1897.\"\nClick here to see more photos of the Japanese-American community in Berkeley before the war.\nThe Berkeley Public Library also has links to books, photo archives, and other information about the internments.\nEditors' note: This is a reprint of a 2010 Berkeleyside article, with a few additions.\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "Remembering Berkeley's Japanese community on 75th anniversary of Executive Order 9066", "Tags": "['Berkeley history']", "Sections": "['Community', 'Community']", "Natural Language Location": "Shattuck and Blake", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8630601", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "249046", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2694988", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/19/remembering-berkeleys-japanese-community-75th-anniversary-executive-order-9066/", "Author": "Frances Dinkelspiel", "Date": "2017-02-19T12:54:05-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Berkeleyside contributing photographer Pete Rosos was clearly prepared for a power outage.

Stern is a 95-year-old Holocaust survivor from Poland and Heitfeld is a 31-year-old German graduate student whose grandparents were active Nazis. Photo: Sasha Khokha/KQEDBy Ryan Levi and Sasha Khokha / KQED\nBen Stern and Lea Heitfeld do the things many roommates do: they cook lunch together, do the dishes, argue about keeping the house clean and the cupboards closed. But they're an unusual pair.\nStern is a 95-year-old Holocaust survivor from Poland. He survived two ghettos, nine concentration camps and two death marches. Heitfeld is a 31-year-old German graduate student at UC Berkeley.\nBut it's not just the six-decade age gap that sets these roomies apart.\n\n\"My grandparents were Nazis,\" Heitfeld said. \"They were very active. They were really into the system.\"\nBut her parents felt differently. They raised her to ask questions about what responsibility non-Jewish Germans had for the Holocaust and to continue to keep this part of German history alive.\n\"My grandparents' generation is not there anymore, so how do you keep memory alive? What is important to be preserved? How is it supposed to be remembered?\" she said. \"I found that very meaningful. I suddenly realized this generation, the survivors, are still around, and how can I say I have nothing to do if I can contribute something?\"\n'As long as I'm not doing anything I will always stay a perpetrator in a way. I will stay someone who hasn't learned from history.' -- Lea HeitfeldShe said that's what led her to the U.S. for a graduate degree in Jewish studies, at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, and to her 95-year-old housemate.\n\"They were looking for a live-in companion for Ben,\" Heitfeld said, \"and my professor wrote me that Ben is the coolest, funniest, most handsome old dude I know.\"\nAfter Stern's wife moved into an assisted-living facility, having Heitfeld around was a chance to not be so lonely, to share meals -- and ideas -- with someone.\n\"I'm open-minded to get along with people,\" Stern said. \"I want to prove it that it can be done.\"\nEven before they met, Stern felt a connection with Heitfeld.\n\"The name Lea meant so much to me,\" he said. \"My grandmother's name was Lea, and I carried her on my arms from the train to the Warsaw Ghetto. She passed away in the Ghetto from starvation, but she was such a dear, warm individual. The name Lea is just dear to me in my head.\"\nBen Stern holds up a copy of a newspaper clipping show him and his wife after they came to the United States as Jewish refugees after World War II. Stern survived two ghettos, nine concentration camps and two death marches. Photo: Sasha Khokha/KQEDHeitfeld is Stern's friend, not his caretaker. The 95-year-old is amazingly active. He walks at least an hour a day on his treadmill, reads books and checks his email. Plus, he's got his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren nearby.\n\"He continues to surprise us,\" said his daughter, Charlene Stern, \"walking a mile and a half to visit my mom almost every day, insisting on doing everything he can still do and finding new ways to do it, despite blindness and deafness. He's a force for life.\"\nAs Stern, Heitfeld and Charlene sat down recently to a lunch of pumpernickel, lox, tomatoes and cheese, Stern shared his secret to longevity.\n\"Being positive in life. Very simple. Optimistic. Positive,\" he said. \"Go forward. Don't look back. I got a lot to look back, and I live with that. I live with both.\"\n\"I thought you were going to tell her about your vodka,\" Charlene adds with a laugh.\nWhile this meal is full of laughter, Stern said mealtimes often turn serious when he and Heitfeld talk about his history.\nHe was just 17 when the Nazis invaded Poland, turning his neighborhood into a prison for Jews. His parents and eight brothers and one sister were all killed. He survived multiple concentration camps and was one of only a tiny percentage to survive a death march from Buchenwald in 1945.\n\"Seven thousand boys left Buchenwald on April 3,\" Stern said. \"We walked 35 days without a piece of bread. Four boiled potatoes every afternoon. Thirty-five days from 7,000, we were 156 who survived.\"\n'You cannot stand by and be indifferent. That is a sin. A colossal sin that will catch up with you later on.' -- Ben SternSeven decades later, Heitfeld is trying to reconcile her country and family's past by living with and sharing a life with Stern.\n\"You find yourself on the side of the perpetrators because you know it's the history of the nation, and it's your family history too,\" she said of being German. \"How can I say I wouldn't have participated if so many people participated?\"\nThis sense of what happened before in her own country has pushed Heitfeld to make sure she's not a bystander when groups are discriminated against today.\n\"Where am I contributing? Where am I standing up? Where am I raising my voice?\" she said. \"As long as I'm not doing anything I will always stay a perpetrator in a way. I will stay someone who hasn't learned from history.\"\nNear Normal Man\nCharlene also wants to make sure that young people like Heitfeld learn from -- and don't repeat -- history.\nShe has produced a new 30-minute film about her father's life, which will be distributed primarily to schools and universities. She hopes the film will reach young people with his message of hope and resilience.\n\"I couldn't stand the thought that as the survivors pass on, the history becomes documents by third-party people,\" Charlene said. \"I've grown up standing next to my parents and their pain. It's very real to me. I was worried that it would become arm's-length ancient history so very quickly. It became important to me, critical that his voice go out, that he tells his own story.\"\nThe film shows Stern's life -- surviving Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, being liberated by the Americans and finding his way to the United States with his new bride. She decided to call the film Near Normal Man.\n\"My father's always said he's near normal for a man who was a fugitive, was enslaved, was beaten, whipped, shot at, starved, marched almost to death twice,\" Charlene said.\nEven all these years later, Charlene is still in awe of her father.\n\"The most astounding fact of having him for a father is where does his courage and kindness and hope come from?\" she said. \"I have been a witness to it every day. He continues to surprise me.\"\nThe film also shows Stern's controversial stance as the leader of a movement to prevent neo-Nazis from marching in his then newly adopted hometown of Skokie, Illinois, in 1978. Charlene said other Jewish-Americans didn't take the hate group seriously and told her dad to \"let it pass.\"\n\"My dad would not let it pass,\" she said.\nStern collected more than 750,000 signatures opposing the march, but the neo-Nazis won the right to march with help from the ACLU.\nEven though it's a controversial comparison to make, Stern said he does see an echo of Nazi Germany in what's already happening to civil rights under President Trump's administration.\n\"I learned a long time ago that history repeats itself,\" he said. \"The European people were mostly indifferent to the Jewish destruction. Many of them were sympathizers. Many took active part in it.\"\nStern said he was taken aback when President Trump did not mention Jews at all in his statement marking Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\"How can you ignore it and not mention the people of the Holocaust?\" he said. \"It's hitting right into the heart, telling you, 'I don't care.' They don't exist for him. And that's what's frightening. And that's why we've got to say, 'Not here, not now.'\"\nHe said someone who is indifferent to the suffering of others is just as guilty as an active collaborator.\n\"That's what I'm applying today to the youth,\" he said. \"You cannot stand by and be indifferent. That is a sin. A colossal sin that will catch up with you later on.\"\nThat's the message Charlene hopes young people will take away from Near Normal Man.\n\"This film is not another Holocaust film. This is a film with the tools for the next generation for America today,\" she said.\nAt 95, Stern remains defiant but also hopeful.\n\"We as American people must say not now, not here. We need to help the people when they reach for a hand out,\" he said. \"I don't know what I'm looking for but I'm hopeful that we as Americans continue to live and enjoy the freedom that this country offers.\n\nCheck out the Near Normal Man' website.

Photo: Emilie RagusoAn estimated 200 neighbors came out in force Sunday to San Pablo Park's auditorium to share their worries and ideas following a spate of recent incidents involving gunfire, as well as more longstanding challenges faced in South and West Berkeley.\nSome described the event as perhaps the most well-attended public safety meeting the area has seen in years. The atmosphere was upbeat and positive, though some have said the city will now need to take action to make true public safety a reality.\nNew West Berkeley Councilwoman Cheryl Davila organized the meeting after hearing about constituent concerns related to gun violence and crime. She teamed up with newly elected Mayor Jesse Arreguin and new South Berkeley Councilman Ben Bartlett to field questions and thoughts from residents. Neighborhood services rep Shallon Allen, from the city manager's office, and Interim Berkeley Police Chief Andrew Greenwood also listened closely, and provided information about the current state of affairs.\nFrom left: Cheryl Davila, Jesse Arreguin, Ben Bartlett, Shallon Allen and Andrew Greenwood. Photo: Emilie RagusoIdeas from neighbors included community-based solutions such as potlucks and evening walks, programs and services for youth to keep them off the streets, and stepped-up enforcement focused on known criminals. And city staff said they want to work with neighbors to implement effective solutions to help address the violence and make Berkeley safer.\n\nPolice Chief Greenwood told attendees that despite about 300 calls since January 2016 about possible gunfire, also known as \"loud reports,\" police only found evidence of gunfire in 35 incidents. Evidence could include casings, property damage or a victim. (Berkeleyside has requested a detailed list.)\nRead more about shootings in Berkeley in 2016 and 2017He said 16 of those incidents took place in South or West Berkeley. Most of them, he added, were linked to just a few individuals. Three were tied to one person, who has since been arrested and charged, Greenwood said. A set of four and a set of five have also been tied to \"common players\" in a \"pool of less than 10 people.\"\n\"We know there are a very small number of people in this community, including a very small number of small gangs, who are responsible for the lion's share of these incidents,\" he said, and are primarily focused on each other. Greenwood declined to identify the gangs, however: \"I'm not going to say gang names because I'm not going to legitimize them in that way.\"\nGreenwood said investigators have been working hard to figure out who's responsible, even when witnesses have not been forthcoming. And he said he understood the fear and frustration in the room, and the concern that BPD has not done enough to address the violence.\n\"You may not know what work we're doing, and that's on us,\" he said.\nHe also said the department has been working hard to boost staffing. Nine new officers are now being tested out under supervision on Berkeley streets.\n\nSome neighbors said the 35 number seemed awfully low, and that they'd like to see Berkeley have a ShotSpotter system like in Oakland and Richmond and, as of recently, at UC Berkeley. The system uses microphones to pick up and record possible gunfire to help police respond quickly to the right spot. Greenwood said those systems may be prohibitively expensive and that BPD's next big technology acquisition is slated to be body-worn cameras.\nDavila said she want to start organizing neighborhood walks, and encouraged residents to keep coming out to community-building events. She's already planned one for Saturday, Feb. 4, in the San Pablo Park auditorium from 2-5 p.m. to \"Unite the Community.\" She's also planning a town hall forum on violence prevention for February or March.\n\"If we can get all of us to do this, that will be a powerful statement,\" she said.\nDavila collected sign-ins and email addresses from meeting attendees, which she said would help her going forward because she's had no email list to this point. (She and the other new council members began their work Dec. 1.) Her city website continues to have no way to sign up for the district email list.\nHundreds of people attended a community meeting Sunday focused on neighborhood safety in South and West Berkeley. Photo: Emilie RagusoAfter brief remarks from city officials, residents got a chance at the mic to raise concerns. One local resident, Marc Weber, described being at San Pablo Park with his young daughter when bullets whizzed past their bodies. He said the city needs to work to instill \"fear into the hearts of the few people responsible for these crimes.\" He suggested going after people with active warrants, and using crime suppression units or a task force to focus on people on probation and parole. He said Berkeleyans, who have one of the highest property tax rates in the Bay Area, deserve to feel safe.\n\"The monies are there,\" he said. \"We have the resources. The allocations simply aren't being put there.\"\nOthers pushed back and said it would be better to talk to the youth and invest in them to help them get on productive pathways forward. Clarence Ford, a former Berkeley Unified student who ended up in prison but is now in graduate school at UC Berkeley, said those relationships can make all the difference.\n\"Berkeley is so small and the people who are doing stuff, they're identifiable right?\" he said. \"And I'm down to do that. I got credibility out here.\"\nCouncilman Bartlett was receptive to that approach.\n\"We all need to confront isolation with togetherness, and confront fear with courage,\" he said. \"When you have the courage to address your fear and open your arms to someone, you have the power to transform their life.\"\n\nLast Tuesday night, police found evidence of a shooting in South Berkeley at Oregon Street and McGee Avenue. Some said it sounded like an automatic weapon. On Wednesday, an apartment building on Dohr Street near Ashby Avenue was damaged by gunfire.\nEarlier this month, Jan. 14, police in Berkeley handled a slew of calls about extensive gunfire at Acton and Russell streets. People in the area after that shooting reported bullet casings littering the street.\nAnd just before New Year's, on Dec. 29, a child received minor injuries from shattered glass that resulted from a shooting in the 1400 block of Ward Street.\nNorman Franklin Sr. told authorities Sunday that recent gunfire was so powerful it pierced a wrought-iron fence around his building.\nAnd one woman pleaded with the city to do more to help stop the shootings. She and others indicated that much of the violence is interrelated. She said her family has faced difficulty since a relative of hers was targeted on Christmas at Sacramento Market.\nAt 2 p.m. that day, police said, gunfire struck a vehicle and business in the 2900 block of Sacramento Street, at Ashby. The bullets missed, but someone sitting in a vehicle was struck in the face by shattering glass.\nThe woman said someone has continually targeted her family since then, and that police need to do more.\n\"I don't want to live like this,\" she said. \"My family has been in Berkeley over 100 years.\"\nAlex Goodwin. Photo: Alex Goodwin/TwitterShe also expressed frustration about the as-yet-unsolved homicide from August of 22-year-old Alex Goodwin Jr. Goodwin lived just south of San Pablo Park and his death hit the neighborhood hard. Numerous speakers, including Goodwin's mother, sister and grandmother, pleaded with authorities Sunday to do everything they can to solve the case.\nThe woman said the Goodwin case was \"related to everything that's gone on with all these shootings,\" and asked: \"When are you going to get these guys off the street?\"\nGoodwin's sister, Aneka Patterson, echoed those concerns.\n\"I know some people who are tired of being shot at, tired of being harassed by these other people and are willing to talk to you guys,\" Patterson told police Sunday. \"I'm pretty sure you guys know the people who are basically terrorizing South Berkeley and it seems like it's just nothing being done.\"\nMayor Jesse Arreguin and city staff urged residents to band together to be vigilant and offer support. Arreguin said the problems of South and West Berkeley have gone unaddressed for too long, and that the new council pledges to reinvest in both neighborhoods. He said local residents must, however, work with each other and with police if they hope to see improvements.\n\"If you're not already part of a neighborhood watch, form a neighborhood watch,\" he said, adding that the city must do more with restorative justice, too.\nCity staffer Shallon Allen told the crowd: \"You have a responsibility to each other to keep each other safe.... There are many, many things you guys can do together, but someone has to take the initiative.\"\nShe added, \"The solutions are not going to come from this dais. The solutions are going to come from the community.\"\n\nSome speakers from the neighborhood urged the city to use best practices, technology and data to tackle the problem. Some pushed for code enforcement to hold property owners accountable. And others pushed for more robust preventive measures. Violence prevention measures need to start as early as possible, they said.\nStill others asked where all the guns are coming from.\nBerkeley Police Sgt. Spencer Fomby told the group there are more than 300 million guns in the United States.\n\"As far as gun control, these guns are everywhere,\" he said. \"These kids can get guns anywhere they want.\"\nCommunity speakers also said the police department needs to do a much better job sharing information with the public about violent incidents, and building trust.\nOne young woman, a 10th-grader at Berkeley High named Laelah Jackson, spoke passionately about the importance of those relationships, and said the community wants to participate if they see good faith efforts from police.\n\"What are you going to do to build that trust?\" she asked. \"All I see you guys doing is picking up homeless people off Shattuck Avenue.\"\nLaelah Jackson asked, \"What are you going to do to build that trust?\" Photo: Emilie RagusoNixle alerts should be used more often, particularly if evidence of gunfire is found, another woman said.\n\"We've had very minimal information,\" she said, noting that her emails to the mayor and council representative had also gone unanswered. \"When you don't have information, what you have is rumors.\"\nShe said neighbors have been brainstorming ideas like buying guns, signing up private security patrols, and adding lights and cameras on people's houses. But she said some of the proposed solutions raise thorny questions, and that it's difficult to come up with an effective plan when so little is known about the dynamics on the street.\n\"We're coming up with strategies so we can take action,\" she said. But, if accurate information is lacking, \"then we will come up with our own [strategies] that aren't necessarily the best.\"\nChief Greenwood made a commitment to do better about sharing information, even if there aren't a lot of details to put out.\n\"We've fallen short on the notification piece,\" he said. \"I hear you on that. We need to do more work, and better work.\"\nGreenwood said police are working to build trust in the community, and cited the example of a new class offered this year at Berkeley High where students learn about the criminal justice system and police work. Despite minimal publicity, dozens of students signed up for the year-long class, enough for two full sections. Many officers visited the class and took students on department tours and ride-alongs to help them learn about police work. The course also helped do the kind of relationship building people have said they'd like to see, he said.\nEarlier in the meeting, Greenwood had the officers in the room introduce themselves to the crowd and share details about their background and education, and about why they got into law enforcement. He also read from the department's newly adopted mission, vision and value statements and emphasized BPD's commitment to Berkeley and its residents.\nGreenwood continued: \"We are building ourselves as part of the community. We reject divisiveness.... that's what we're about.\"\n\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "Meeting after shootings draws hundreds", "Tags": "['2016 shootings', '2017 shootings', 'Andrew Greenwood', 'Ben Bartlett', 'Berkeley crime', 'Berkeley Police', 'Cheryl Davila', 'Guns in Berkeley', 'Jesse Arreguin', 'Public safety', 'Shootings in Berkeley', 'South Berkeley', 'West Berkeley']", "Sections": "['Community', 'Community', 'Crime', 'Crime & Safety']", "Natural Language Location": "San Pablo Park Auditorium", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8549828", "Zip Code": "94702", "ID": "246475", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2860289", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/01/30/meeting-berkeley-shootings-draws-hundreds/", "Author": "Emilie Raguso", "Date": "2017-01-30T16:57:40-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "A 100-foot-tall blue gum tree was one of the trees that fell this week.

(Due to space constraints, the service is primarily for friends, colleagues and family of the deceased and is not open to the public.)\nThe bodies of Roger Hanna Morash, 35, and Valerie Morash 32, were found Monday afternoon in their apartment at 3028 Deakin. Their two Singapura cats, Minsky and Malloc, were also dead. Cause of death has not been determined.\nJohn Brabyn, executive director of The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute where Val Morash worked, made available the following statement about her Thursday, writing, \"we have all suffered a tragic loss through the untimely death of an outstanding scientist and human being Val Morash, PhD, and her husband Roger.\"\nThe statement appears below in full.\n\nThe Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute mourns the tragic loss of one of its most outstanding scientists, Valerie Morash PhD. Val was an amazing researcher and a wonderful person who breathed not only scientific brilliance but empathy and good humor into everything she did. With degrees in engineering, statistics and psychology, her skills had extraordinary breadth as well as depth.\nVal applied these talents to her chosen area of research aimed at improving the braille, tactile and haptic skills of blind and visually impaired people, and at solving other issues faced by blind people including access to information and education.\nVal was a true pioneer in research on tactile and haptic perception, exploring many understudied issues about which objective knowledge has been sorely needed in order to improve training programs for blind students and consumers. For example, what are the optimal methods of reading braille - using one or two hands, single or multiple fingers? What type of scanning strategies are best? Similarly for exploring and learning tactile objects and graphics, what are the optimal cues and strategies for the fingers and hands? Answers to these and related questions are vital if blind people are to get maximum benefit from braille and tactile materials of all types.\nVal was also interested in how to reduce barriers to educational assessment including IQ tests and mathematical achievement - currently these are mostly inaccessible or difficult to apply to blind students and can lead to incorrect assessment of abilities and aptitudes, in turn leading to inappropriate decisions on streaming and curricula in education. She also conducted research and development of assistive technology aimed at directly helping blind students in such problems as understanding graphics, and at helping Teachers of the Visually Impaired better understand and integrate assistive technology into their work.\nAside from her outstanding academic and technical skills, Val was known for being the most helpful, pleasant and collaborative colleague possible. Always ready to help other scientists with their problems, whether in statistics, engineering or any other subject, Val was the ultimate team player.\nIt is hard to put into words the feeling of devastating loss and grief felt for Val by all her colleagues at Smith-Kettlewell. We deeply mourn her passing, and share the grief of her family, friends and other colleagues and collaborators.\nFor more information about Val:http://www.ski.org/users/valhttp://valeriemorash.com\nFriends of the couple are raising money to offset family costs related to the funeral.

Photo: Ling Woo LiuIf the late Ed Roberts was the father of the modern disability rights movement, then 96-year-old Zona Roberts is its grandmother. Decades before the Americans with Disabilities Act, the introduction of special education, and a California law recognizing Ed Roberts Day annually on Jan. 23, Zona battled for public education, healthcare and independence for her son, who contracted polio at the age of 14.\nNow a new administration is threatening hard-fought gains by promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act -- a move that would disproportionately threaten those with disabilities due to their pre-existing conditions -- and restrict Medicaid, which covers an array of critical services for people with disabilities.\n\"I'm absolutely stunned that Trump would become our president,\" said Roberts recently, \"but I think people are well prepared to fight for their rights now. I absolutely think we will prevail.\"\nIn 1962, Ed Roberts, who had post-polio quadriplegia, and whose breathing depended on an iron lung, became the first student with a serious disability to attend an American university. A decade later, he co-founded The Center for Independent Living (CIL), which counts accessible curbs and ramps among its many victories.\n\nSince then, The CIL has inspired 400 similar centers around the world. Between 1976 and 1983, Ed served as the director of California's Department of Rehabilitation, which helps enable people with disabilities to live independently. In 2010, 15 years after Ed's passing, California proclaimed Jan. 23 (his birthday) Ed Roberts Day. The day has also been recognized in Minnesota and Wisconsin.\nEd Roberts surrounded by his parents and three siblings. Photo: Courtesy of Zona RobertsWhile Ed's story is widely known among disability-rights advocates, lesser known is the story of the woman who raised him and fiercely advocated for his rights, as well as his independence. In 1953, when 14-year-old Ed, the eldest of her four children, was suddenly diagnosed with polio and placed in an 800-pound iron lung, Zona was as overwhelmed and confused as any other parent of a child with a complex illness.\n\"We didn't know anyone with a disability. Everyone felt sorry for us, and they were afraid they might catch polio,\" she said.\nEd remained in the hospital for the next two years. During that time, many \"polios\" as they were then called, remained hospitalized or institutionalized, often without the support of their families. While Ed's quality of life improved after he returned to the family's home in Burlingame, CA, his round-the-clock care placed an enormous burden on Zona, as well as the rest of the family. Managing Ed's very physical care (which involved four people lifting him for baths), in addition to raising three other children and maintaining her marriage, required seeking therapy, despite societal stigma, and finding respite care.\n\"In order to find my way through,\" she said, \"I had to be amenable to getting help.\"\nAfter Ed's two-year absence from school, Zona fought for him to continue high school by using a special phone device that allowed him to attend class remotely. At the end of his senior year, she says, the school told Ed that he didn't qualify for graduation because he hadn't taken PE or driver's education classes. When Zona escalated the matter, the assistant superintendent paid the family a visit.\n\"He looked at Ed in his iron lung and said, 'Ed, you wouldn't want a cheap diploma, would you?'\" said Zona, still bristling with anger. \"It's a wonder how that man got out of our house in one piece.\"\nAfter Zona brought the issue before the school board, Ed finally received his diploma.\nGoogle honored Ed Roberts today, the occasion of what would have been his 78th birthday, with a Google Doodle.Following three years at a local community college, Ed was accepted into UC Berkeley in 1962. But when his iron lung wouldn't fit into a dorm room, he was moved to the campus' Cowell Hospital, where he remained for the rest of college. During that time, he and a growing cohort of students with disabilities, inspired by the countrywide civil-rights movement, launched the nation's first program for students with disabilities.\nZona stayed with Ed for his first week in Berkeley, but once she found him a personal assistant, she visited him only occasionally. \"Was I worried? No, I was relieved.\" she said. \"He was out of the house and I got my life back!\"\nZona herself earned a teaching certificate from UC Berkeley in 1969, at the age of 49. She later worked at the Physically Disabled Students Program and at CIL (both organizations co-founded by her son) before opening her own counseling practice to assist people caring for family members with disabilities.\nToday, Zona, who still lives in Berkeley, continues to embody that spirit of independence. The razor-sharp, yoga-practicing nonagenarian zips around her two-story 1911 Craftsman in a way that belies her knee pain. In her six decades of activism, she has seen students with disabilities mainstreamed in the education system, as well as the passage of the American with Disabilities Act, more accessible polling stations for all voters with disabilities, and insurance coverage for some 90% of children and adults with disabilities. With some of these gains now under threat, she says that Ed would \"be ready for the battle to begin.\"\nLing Woo Liu is the director of communications and community engagement at the Lucile Packard Foundation for Children's Health.

Golden Gate Audubon members were already somewhat familiar with the area from annual Christmas Bird Counts and a bird survey they did of the broader Eastshore State Park area in 2006.\nBut even they were surprised by the abundance and tenacity of birds in the area, which gets heavy use by people and dogs.\n\"It surprised me how much nesting activity there was,\" said Pam Young, a Golden Gate Audubon board member and Berkeley resident who led the volunteer bird surveyors. \"We found nests in places like along the parking lot where you'd think, 'How can they possibly nest there?' Despite all the human disturbance, there are some very tenacious birds breeding out there. It's a wonderful story of resilience and persistence.\"\nRed-tailed hawk in pine. Photo: Pam YoungThe survey project - funded in part by a grant from the California State Parks Foundation - had its roots in a desire by CESP to ensure that the natural resources of the Bulb and Neck were understood and protected.\n\"The wildlife and song birds of the Bulb are spectacular,\" said Robert Cheasty, CESP Executive Director. \"The Bulb provides a refuge to endangered species and a recreational opportunity for the entire East Bay community.\"\nThe area, owned by the City of Albany, had been in transition for several years.\nCreated at a time when businesses and local governments routinely filled in the Bay, the Bulb and Neck were built on debris generated by creation of the Golden Gate Fields race track in 1939 and then a city landfill in 1963.\nSee a full list of the bird species found at Albany Bulb and Neck.Lawsuits against the landfill operator brought dumping to a halt in 1983. Albany city officials weighed a number of proposals to develop the Bulb for uses like high-rise hotels and a marina. But in 2002, CESP succeeded in getting the area set aside for parkland.\nThe East Bay Regional Park District agreed to manage the site as part of the new McLaughlin Eastshore State Park. But first the city had to remove the homeless camps, which was completed amidst heavy media coverage and controversy in 2013-14.\nWhen CESP was considering doing a bird survey, it approached Golden Gate Audubon Society, which has a century's worth of experience conducting bird censuses.\nGolden Gate Audubon member and CESP Board member Steve Granholm developed the protocol for the survey: Three teams of two surveyors took turns visiting the site twice each month. They started at the same place and time of day and walked a defined two-hour route noting every bird that both members heard or saw.\nThey made two prescribed stops, where they would spend two minutes documenting all birds within a 360-degree circle around them. Not only did they note the species, but they described the behavior - if the bird was flying over, perching, feeding, gathering nesting material etc.\nThe volunteer surveyors, who completed their work in June 2016, came away with an enhanced appreciation of the Bulb and Neck as wildlife habitat\nWhite-crowned Sparrow. Photo: Pam Young\"Because it juts out away from other land masses and the mudflats are protected, you get some amazing birds coming in,\" Young said. \"Anyone who spends time out there really ends up valuing the area.\"\nThey cited the importance of the area's Coyote brush - a plant native to Northern California coastal areas, which has been targeted for removal by land managers for aesthetic and security reasons. Coyote brush was found to house a number of bird species, including California Towhees, House Finches, and Bushtits.\n\"Many land managers believe that brush should be removed, but that's where the birds are,\" Young said.\nCESP and GGAS identified several steps that land managers should take to ensure the continued viability of the Bulb and Neck for wildlife:\nMinimize construction, relying on low-impact paths and trails rather than developed or paved trails.\nProtect important habitat such as brush, salt marsh, and mud flats.\nEncourage park visitors to discover and enjoy the remarkable wildlife of the Bulb and Neck.\nMerlin in flight above cypress.

Photo: Laura Jadwin FacebookLisa Jadwin, the sister of Laura Jadwin, 55, who died in a lot on MLK on Friday night, wrote to Berkeleyside about Laura's life. Her comments are below:\nThanks for the two pieces Berkeleyside wrote about Laura. It's heartening to the family that her death and life are being recognized, by your articles and by the vigil held in her honor.\nI thought I'd share some email thoughts about Laura's story.\nLaura was a 1983 graduate of UC Davis and worked for many years as a horticulturist and landscaper at various establishments including the Orchid Garden in Carmel Valley and a big nursery in Laguna Beach. She lived for nearly twenty years in Pacific Grove. She loved plants and had a strong design sense that her clients loved and was an accomplished mosaicist. She was married from 1997 to 2009 to an artisanal ironworker who still lives in the Monterey area.\n\nHer alcoholism first became apparent to our family in the early 1990s and she spent many years and much effort trying to recover from it. She had eight stints in rehab and several long periods of sobriety when the family hoped that she had finally turned the corner on her disease.   She has left us many diaries and pieces of artwork she created as she worked through her 12-step program. One of her best rehab experiences was with Options Recovery Services in Oakland, where she had nine months of sobriety and a very good support system. (The people who run that place are AMAZING.) In the last six years, she was hospitalized in the ICU and was near death twice, first in the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula in 2011 and in 2016 by Alta Bates hospital in Berkeley. The medical staff at both hospitals treated her with exceptional care and compassion.\nWhat is really hard to say is that our family knew that she had chosen to be homeless. My father continually wrote her checks, hoping that she would spend the money on a motel room, which she sometimes did. But we rarely knew where she was. In November, she chose to leave a shelter where she could get her needs for shelter, food, and medical help met but would not be allowed to drink.\nHer homelessness seems to have been part of a downward spiral of hopes raised and dashed, and she seemed to know and accept that her plan to drink towards oblivion would eventually kill her.\nThere are so many things about this story that are hard to hear about and hard to accept, but our family has come to understand that her disease was stronger than anything she or her large group of family and friends could help her with. Many, many people helped her work toward recovery; she was not ignored or cast aside or turned away against her will. Ultimately she chose her own way of ending her ordeal of consciousness.\nA shrine at the Tuesday vigil for Laura Jadwin. Photo: Frances DinkelspielOur family is heartbroken; her path downward has been very steep since my mother's death in 2010.\nI wish I could say that I know what could have saved Laura, what else could have been done, how things should or could have been different.

Photo: Wikimedia CommonsThe Berkeley Hills boast stunning natural beauty, high education levels, big incomes and robust property values. But like a debutante with an STD, the neighborhood also has an embarrassing secret: a recent upsurge in reported rat activity.\nThe pests are nesting on car engines, where they sharpen their teeth by chewing on wires, which leads to major repair costs. Worse, Roof Rats are invading attics and Norway Rats are moving into basements and crawl spaces, pushing exterminator bills to thousands of dollars.\n\"Based on [the] number of calls to my office and posts on Nextdoor.com, I think it's safe to say that North Berkeley has a rat infestation problem,\" wrote City Councilwoman Susan Wengraf in her newsletter in November.\n\"We've lived here on Avenida for 50 years,\" one hills homeowner said. \"There is a dramatic increase in the arrivals of rats. Alameda County identified a serious infestation two years ago. ... We had a hole we didn't know about and it will cost us $7,000 to clean, remove and re-sterilize our attic and some crawl spaces.\"\n\nThe homeowner cautions DIYers not to clean up rat droppings without wearing a mask and waterproof gloves. The vermin can be vectors for diseases such as salmonellosis, leptospirosis, murine typhus, even the plague, although the plague is clearly not as common in urban areas now as it was the Middle Ages.\nAt Berkeley's Environmental Health Division, Manager Manuel Ramirez takes a measured approach when asked if rat problems are growing in the hills. \"I haven't noticed an increase in complaints,\" he said, \"but rodent infestation is always an issue in a city environment. They're here for a reason: we're providing them with shelter and food.\"\nThe hills' ample foliage harbors them, and residents overfeeding of wild birds and pets can guarantee a steady meal plan for nocturnal scavengers. In addition, construction activity can drive pests from their preferred habitats into our cars and homes, Ramirez said.\nThis reporter and Berkeley Hills resident has his own experiences with the rodents. Rats tried to nest on the engines of my cars last summer. They seemed bent on preparing nests for winter. I baited snap traps with peanut butter (it's what the pros use) and placed the traps in the engine compartments. Then I propped the hoods open about 1.5 ft. using wood poles so the engine compartments weren't so protected and inviting to the shy creatures.\nRats are wily. I learned that trapping them requires persistence: keeping the traps ready even if the prey gets away a few times. Eventually, I caught a couple of rats and the problem ended, no wires chewed.\nOthers report far worse car-rat encounters. \"Two days apart our two cars (one old, one new) wouldn't start and had to be towed,\" said Monika Eisenbud two days before Christmas. \"Rats had chewed wiring in both, with the wiring harness needing replacement in both cars (pricey!). This has never happened to us before in 20 years of living in the Berkeley Hills.\"\nAdds another neighbor: \"I had extensive rat damage on my Range Rover a few years ago where they chewed through the engine wires and casing and caused about $7,000 in damage. It took the shop about a month to repair. When it's super cold, rats like to hide in warm places ... We solved the issue by having a pest-control person put traps around the car.\"\nThe city offers extensive advice on rodent-proofing homes.\nWhat else can be done? Some residents recommend getting a pet cat, or - better yet - befriending a fierce feral one.\nKristen Van Dam, who lives near Tilden Park, recommends owl power: \"I am (among other things) a site assessor for the Hungry Owl Project,\" she says. \"Barn owls are by far the most prolific consumers of rodents out of all our local owls. And, unlike cats, they don't prey on native songbirds. If there are a few neighbors interested in setting up a barn owl box, I'd be happy to provide expertise and advice.\"\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "Rats chew car wires, enter homes in Berkeley Hills, causing costly damage", "Tags": "['Animals in Berkeley', 'Berkeley Hills', 'Berkeley wildlife']", "Sections": "['Animals', 'Animals', 'Community', 'Nature']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley Hills", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8954586", "Zip Code": "94707", "ID": "244889", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2816273", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/01/19/rats-chew-car-wires-enter-homes-in-berkeley-hills-causing-costly-damage/", "Author": "Steve Taylor", "Date": "2017-01-19T07:00:14-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "\nKnow where this is?

Photo: Courtesy of Inman familyAn artist and a singer, an adventurer and an educator, Emilie Inman was unapologetically herself, a young woman who was known for her unwavering belief in unconditional love.\nInman, 27, was killed at her South Berkeley home Jan. 6. On Tuesday morning, Jan. 17, the person authorities believe is responsible is set to appear in court for the first time. Friends and family have grappled with Inman's abrupt death, and many shared beautiful reflections and memories by email with Berkeleyside in recent days.\nBest friend Minea Herwitz said it had been a devastating loss, both for those who knew Inman and for those who would never have the chance. The two women met a decade ago when they were students at UC Santa Cruz. Their lives collided, literally, when Inman tackled Herwitz during a game of midnight frisbee.\n\"No one loved as hard as Emilie,\" said Herwitz. \"She was spreading the practice of positive and powerful communication, of speaking one's truth, and of fully becoming one's own unique self. She was on her way to becoming probably the most amazing children's teacher children that the world will now never get to see. She was a walking artwork whose hands and voice manifested countless beautiful things: paintings, poems, earthen totems, songs (oh her songs!) and so much more.\"\n\nInman's longtime partner Matt said she was happiest seeing others in passionate pursuit of what they loved, whether it was their creative hobbies, a meaningful career or personal growth. (Matt and several others asked not to be identified by last name out of privacy concerns due to the nature of the case.) The two were together for nearly eight years, and met in college when Inman was 19.\n\"From her deeply caring hugs, to her passion for educating and relentlessly being the change she wanted to see in the world, Emilie has been nothing but a source of encouragement and inspiration to those who interacted with her,\" he said, in a prepared statement. \"I know that she helped many of us find our purpose or provided validation that we were on the right path. Simply put -- and in language she would use -- she got stoked seeing other humans stoked on what they love to do.\"\nFriend Barbara Tolbert met Inman in San Francisco in 2012-13 when Tolbert lived with Matt. Tolbert recalled how Inman had heard her playing music in her room, and came in to join in.\nEmilie Inman (left) with her friend Barbara. Photo: CourtesyTolbert recalled Inman as \"one of the most intoxicatingly liberated and affectionate human beings that any person could ever meet. She was unforgettable, exceedingly welcoming and generous, and overflowing with talent. Indeed, too magical for this plane of existence.\"\nMany friends described Inman's radiance and positivity, her shining face and her beaming smile. They spoke about her authenticity, joy and vivaciousness, and how she was someone who brought out the best from everyone around her. Inman was brave, and she was compassionate, they said.\n\"She was always very excited to explore the world around her and teach others what she knew. Especially if it involved music or climbing trees,\" said Nicole, who worked with Inman in 2011-12 when they were both naturalist interns at an outdoor school outside Petaluma. \"Emilie inspired many of us to sing and learn musical instruments so we could all sit together in our living room playing and enjoying each others' company. It was always beautiful to fill the lodge with song and happiness.\"\nFriend Aparajita said the two met in 2014 when they began an education program in El Sobrante at the Bay Area Center for Waldorf Teacher Training. Inman would have graduated from the three-year certification course in July.\n\"Emilie embodied beauty, truth, and goodness in every aspect of her being,\" she said. \"I consider her my teacher, friend, and kid sister all at once.\"\nMonica, who met Inman in 2011, described her friend as an artist and teacher, and a \"community creator.\" The two were part of a Bay Area sharing circle for women that Inman had helped organize.\n\"She put love first in all interactions and saw great success. She loved the earth, she loved people, and she never hesitated to share her light with people and things in pain and darkness,\" Monica said. \"Emilie had no time for smallness, she elevated everyone and everything she touched. She challenged us to think big and to be bold.\"\nEmilie Inman on a recent camping trip to Joshua Tree for New Year's 2017. Photo credit: Lili Nakita PhotographyInman was someone who always pushed herself to be at her best and to live without fear. Many who knew her said that passion was infectious. Friend Tim Kopra, who attended UC Santa Cruz with Inman but got to know her better at Burning Man in 2012, said there's no question Inman's influence and memory will live on.\n\"She will echo in howls at full moons, songs played around campfires, deep conversations, and care taken for others. She loved all she met, and always welcomed the stranger. She gave every being on the planet the benefit of the doubt and believed that all beings were intrinsically good and loving,\" he said.\nAfter their time at Burning Man, Kopra said he was among a group of friends who shared many small dinners organized by Inman, which often featured jamming on musical instruments and celebrating the full moon or other celestial phenomena.\n\"Emilie Inman was a deep dreamer, passionate lover, kind caretaker, and a bright light to those in darkness,\" he said. \"She was a teacher, leader, brilliant musician, and artist. She believed that everyone has a responsibility to share their gifts, and that each individual on this planet deserves to do what makes them happy.\"\nEmilie Inman with some of her artwork. Photo: CourtesyNasimeh Bahrayni Easton recalled how the two women met when they interviewed for the same job at Sienna Ranch in Lafayette about 2.5 years ago. Easton said the organization liked them both so much, they both got offered the position to share. Eventually, Easton moved on, but Inman was a teacher at Sienna Ranch at the time of her death.\nEaston said Inman saw the good in everyone, and saw promise in every child.\n\"It was truly her calling to be with young folks,\" she said. \"The way she saw love and light in every being was incredible.... It was impossible not to love Emilie.\"\nAt the time of her death, Inman was a nature program instructor for fifth- and sixth-graders at Sienna Ranch, according to its website. The organization describes itself as \"a family-owned business whose focus is on youth, families, environment, and community.\"\nChris Lauf, director of Sienna Ranch, said in a statement that Inman's loss \"has shaken our community to the core.\" He said Inman had a bright future in teaching ahead of her, and had been devoted to equity in education. At the time of her death, she had been an advocate of a new scholarship program the school was creating. Lauf said the scholarship will be named after Inman to honor her memory.\nParents described Inman as a passionate teacher who brought her subjects to life, according to Lauf, who shared the following statement from a parent.\n\"Emilie knew just how to transport this diverse group of friends from one world to another filled with fascinating plants, fuzzytailed friends, mud puddles, hillside daydream, and original songs she had written. As the group evolved to include more students from our extended community, Emilie continued to embrace ALL children, especially those with special and complex needs. \"\nEmilie Inman traveled and studied abroad in India in fall 2010. Photo: Photo Courtesy of the Inman familyAccording to Inman's biography on the Sienna Ranch website, she was \"born and raised in the French countryside and Paris\" and \"had a love of nature and humans.\" Her family moved to San Luis Obispo when she was 10, and she went on to major in environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz.\n\"Teaching K-4th grade classes about intertidal species in Santa Cruz dressed in sea star costumes, working as a naturalist at Walker Creek Ranch in Petaluma, CA, 6 months of travel in New Zealand and working at the Marine Science Institute in Redwood City all are part of her story,\" according to the bio.\nFriends said it was impossible to make sense of Inman's death, but credited their lost friend with helping them see a path forward.\nWrote Easton: \"For her to have met such a tragic, sudden, early end is not only unthinkable the only way I can seem to process it is that this is some sort of wake up call, some sort of shaking up of all of us, to live as she did. For if we all did, wo! This earth would be an even more incredible place.\"\nFriend Matt Goff met Inman in Santa Cruz six years ago. They moved to Berkeley around the same time, too. Goff described Inman as a woman who embodied love and kindness, and saw every challenge, even the painful ones, as an opportunity to grow.\nInman wasn't one to falter or contradict herself, he said. And he said he believed she would want her death to be a reminder that every moment is precious and that life is beautiful.\n\"I know my heart is bigger now for having known her, and I am grateful for that,\" he said. \"She will always be here for me, because I can think of her anytime I'm struggling and need guidance. I only have to think, 'what would Emilie say?' And I know exactly what she would say.... She would tell me to do the right thing, the thing that I know I must do, even if it's the hardest option. She would tell me to act with love and empathy and kindness and to trust myself and my heart, and then she would tell me she loved me and that she knew I could do it, and she would give me a big hug,\"\nA playlist created by Matt, Inman's partner, appears below.\n\n", "Coder Initials": "GI", "Title": "Friends remember Emilie Inman: 'No one loved as hard'", "Tags": "['2017 homicide', 'Berkeley crime', 'Berkeley Police', 'Emilie Inman', 'Homicide in Berkeley', 'Pablo Gomez Jr.', 'Public safety']", "Sections": "['Community', 'Community', 'Crime', 'Crime & Safety']", "Natural Language Location": "Ashby and Florence", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8563712", "Zip Code": "94705", "ID": "244317", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2604329", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/01/17/friends-remember-emilie-inman-no-one-loved-hard/", "Author": "Emilie Raguso", "Date": "2017-01-17T09:00:53-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "In an Uncharted special evening organized by Berkeleyside, Jamelle Bouie, left, will be in conversation with Lance Knobel, and Christina Greer, right, will be in conversation with Aimee Allison, on Monday in Berkeley,Update, Jan. 17: The video of these two conversation is now available to watch.\nOriginal story: The Uncharted Berkeley Festival of Ideas' 'emergency' evening, 'WTF Now?

Photo: Joe ParksUpdate: Since we launched our newly designed site, at 11;30 p.m. Tuesday, we have heard back from many readers with largely very positive feedback -- \"beautiful,\" \"sick,\" and \"professional\" are just three words used to describe it -- and people are loving how mobile-friendly it is. One big ask from our readers, however, has been whether we could put date-stamps on our homepage stories. Never let it be said we don't listen carefully to our community: the deed is done, and front-page stories now include bylines and date-stamps!\nOriginal story: Notice something different?\nAfter several years of wanting to do a comprehensive redesign of Berkeleyside, we are excited to launch our brand-new look today.\nThe redesign was prompted by a number of factors -- all of which aim to make the experience of reading Berkeleyside more enjoyable for our readers. First, we felt the site had outgrown the \"reverse chronology\" blog format. When we have important news, it made no sense to see it knocked down the page by something that was comparatively minor, but more recent. Our new look is much more akin to a traditional newspaper website, with lead stories at the top, and all stories organized by their category, be it arts, real estate, crime, food (Nosh) or community, among others.\n\nSecond, in the last 12 months, 50% of visits to Berkeleyside have been made using either a mobile phone or tablet. The experience for those readers, to be frank, was, until today, poor. Berkeleyside's new design, by our long-time collaborator Doug Ng, has been created mobile-first, which means reading our reporting on your phone should now be a pleasure rather than a chore.\nWe're confident you'll find our new site a better experience whatever device you use. The new design provides easy access to our different categories of coverage so you can drill down into the subjects that interest you most. We've also redesigned Nosh, our comprehensive coverage of East Bay food and drink. There's also an array of editorial bells and whistles with the new design: better use of photos and videos, and new ways to show supplementary information.\nThe elements of the new Berkeleyside look:\n- Newspaper rather than blog design\n- Ways to highlight important stories\n- Mobile-first design\n- New positions for advertisers\n- Ability to showcase great photography and video\n- Content-rich site with access to many more storiesIf you're already missing the chronological publishing order, and are worried you'll miss any of our stories, don't panic. You can click on Today's News in the bar at the top of the homepage. The big lead story and the stories in the the Top Stories section on the homepage are our most recent stories. (If you're looking at the site on a mobile device, it's easy: the top story is the most recent.) To be sure never to miss a new Berkeleyside story, sign up for our Daily Briefing email, which pulls together all of the day's stories, our News Alert email, which we send out only for important or breaking stories, and Nosh Weekly, which brings you the past week's top food and drink articles. Sign up for one or all of these free newsletters.\nWe expect the changes will be disconcerting for some readers. Having weathered redesigns with other sites, magazines and newspapers, our advice is this: Give it a few days. We're eager to hear your reactions when you've had a chance to get used to the new look. Email us directly at editors@berkeleyside.com so we can keep all your feedback in one place.\nThe redesign is also the most visible fruit so far of our ambitious development plans for Berkeleyside, made possible in part both by our 1,200 Berkeleyside members, and by the 162-and-counting readers who have invested in our journalism through our direct public offering. Thank you for your support over the past seven years.

Forecasters predict \"mammoth\" amounts of rain in Bay Area this weekend. Photo: Pete RososIt was a chilly 38 degrees in Berkeley on Friday morning, but the cold snap is nothing compared to what is coming.\nWeather forecasters are predicting that mammoth amounts of rain will fall in the Bay Area this weekend. From Saturday to Monday, urban areas could see as much as 2.5 to 4.5 inches of rain, according to Charles Bell of the National Weather Service. The hilly areas could see from 5-9 inches. It will be windy, too, with gusts in the hills rising to 50 mph, which may knock down trees and power lines, said Bell.\nThe heavy rainfall is due to an \"atmospheric river\" that is funneling moist air laden with rain and snow into California, according to the California Weather Blog. The river is wide enough that large parts of California, from the Oregon border to Los Angeles, will be affected.\nNorth America from space. Elements of this image furnished by NASA\"Since this system is expected to be slow-moving, the associated atmospheric river may stall over some portion of northern or central California on Sunday or Monday -- or even waver back northward temporarily,\" according to the California Weather Blog. \"If and when this occurs, there may be a 100-200 mile wide band of even higher precipitation totals. It's impossible to say at this time where any stalling or frontal waves might occur, but that has the potential to be a serious situation locally.\"\n\nPG&E is revving up for the storm by sending out crews to trim tree limbs that are close to power lines, said Andrea Menniti, a spokeswoman for the utility. Friday, crews were trimming trees on Henry Street near Rose Avenue, she said. A local vegetation management team identifies which limbs are precariously close to power lines, she said.\nPG&E crews were out trimming trees on Henry Street on Friday Jan. 6, in preparation for large storms that are supposed to blow in this weekend. Photo: PG&EPG&E is also planning to open its emergency centers this weekend so as to be able to respond to power outages quickly, said Menniti. It is an \"all-hands-on-deck\" kind of weekend, she said.\n\"With storms bearing down on our region, we want our customers to know that PG&E is prepared, that we're mobilizing resources and that we will work around the clock to restore service to customers,\" Pat Hogan, PG&E's senior vice president of electric transmission and distribution said in a press release. \"Likewise, we encourage our customers to have a personal or family preparedness plan in place and - above all else - stay safe.\"\nPG&E has an online outage map, too.\nThe city of Berkeley has also prepared for cold, wet weather. In the past few weeks, after the city activated an Emergency Operations Center to focus resources on those without shelter, the city has greatly expanded its shelter capacity. It can now offer shelter to 380 individuals a night, according to city reports.\nThe city opened a new emergency shelter on Dec. 23 at 1231 Second St. Unlike the city's other emergency shelters, this one allows people to bring their dogs, and also has bicycle parking and a greater area for storage, according to city spokesman Matthai Chakko. The new emergency shelter, which used to house public works employees, has two indoor bathrooms. The city is building an additional two bathrooms outside, one of which is ADA-accessible, he said.\nThe new emergency shelter can accommodate about 45 people and it has been very well used since it opened, said Chakko. Berkeley runs three other emergency shelters: at the North Berkeley Senior Center, the Frances Albrier Community Center and at the First Presbyterian Church. Each of those shelters can accommodate 65 people. These beds are in addition to the 140 shelter beds Berkeley provides through contracts with community agencies.\nThe emergency shelters are opened when there is a 30% or more chance of rain, or when temperatures drop below 40 degrees.\nBerkeley has also contracted to open places during the day where those without homes can seek shelter from the elements. The Multi-Agency Service Center in the Veterans' Building, at 1931 Center St., is now open from 8 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. (Previously it shut at noon.) Berkeley Food & Housing has opened a space in the same building that will be open from 4:45 p.m. until 6:30 p.m. Most overnight shelters open around 7 p.m., although those hours can be pushed back in the public buildings if events are going on, said Chakko.\nOn Friday, Berkeley officials rousted the homeless encampment set up in the Gourmet Ghetto at Spruce and Rose streets by the group First They Came for the Homeless, according to the group's Facebook post.\nA number of homeless individuals have been preparing for the wet weather by buying tarps, according to Quentin Moore, the manager of Berkeley Ace Hardware on Milvia Street. The store has also seen an uptick in the sale of utility pumps and sandbags, he said. Moore expects sales of these and other emergency items to increase as the rains begin.\nBerkeley is also handing out sandbags at the City Corporation Yard on 1326 Allston Way, Mon - Fri, 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Residents must show I.D.\n\"City staff will be available to deal with downed trees or flooding affecting local homes, businesses or streets. In an emergency, they can be reached by dialing 311 on a mobile phone or landline. If outside the city, call 981-2489. Crews will be dispatched and respond as quickly as possible.\"\nCity officials warn not to touch damaged power lines or electrical equipment, and to call 911 immediately. Then they should notify PG&E at 1-800-743-5002.\nFor more tips from the city of Berkeley, click here.\nAlameda County Public Works will be posting updates here.

Prior to this, people were forced to go to numerous agencies and there wasn't a way to ensure that they received all the services for which they were eligible. Now those experiencing housing can come to The Hub at 1901 Fairview St. near Adeline Street and receive access to the help they need. This new coordinated and centralized system allows the city to collect data about the needs and demographics of the people experiencing homelessness in Berkeley. It also prevents the duplication of services.\nAs we end year one of the new model for homeless services delivery in Berkeley, I would like to reflect on our successes, challenges faced, and lessons learned.\nWe all know there is a critical shortage of affordable housing in the Bay Area. Finding housing for people with no recent tenancy is a challenge. Finding that housing and having it affordable is an even bigger challenge. And sometimes, when we do find housing, it may not be in Berkeley, disappointing those who want to remain here. Not everybody can get exactly what he or she wants.\nRunning a new pilot program invariably means that we don't get everything right from the beginning. Over this past year, as this new system of service delivery developed, we learned a lot about what was working and what wasn't working so well. As frequently as twice a month, we analyzed and evaluated our data in order to allow us to pivot quickly, to adjust procedures, and to redeploy human resources.\nThe new services system requires a tremendous amount of interagency coordination. Through a series of monthly collaboration meetings, Berkeley homeless service agencies have worked alongside of us, to develop this new system together. This has required an \"all in\" approach. We are grateful to our collaborative partners, especially our shelter providers YEAH! and BOSS for the ongoing feedback and willingness to find solutions.\nThis new centralized system has given us the ability to create a \"by name\" list of the most vulnerable homeless people in Berkeley. In the past year, we have assessed and prioritized 232 individuals as highly vulnerable and most in need. Of those 232, 37 have already moved into housing and another 83 are in a \"housing search.\" These numbers may seem small, a drop in the ocean of the 893* homeless in Berkeley, but this is incredibly hard work and we see every individual who gets and maintains housing as a victory. We are learning that as the system gets built, the flow to housing is speeding up. For the 600 or so remaining individuals and families they are matched with county-funded shelter and case management services, drug treatment, job training, DV services, and veteran's services. Homeless families are referred to the North County Resource Center.\nOne of the lessons we learned early on was that we needed to deploy our intake staff outdoors. As our outreach team, deployed in January, began to meet people in Berkeley's five main encampments, we realized that doing the actual intakes in encampments is an essential and effective means to begin relationships with many of those living outdoors. So starting in March, our intake workers and case managers joined our outreach team , bringing services outdoors. The Housing First model is focused on helping people move into housing as quickly as possible and removing whatever barriers to tenancy might exist. And if someone doesn't want to live in a shelter or decides to leave a shelter, we continue to work with them and continue to assist with their transition into housing. Services are no longer predicated on having to live in a shelter first as they used to be.\nWe have also been heartened to learn that it is still possible, in this hyper inflated market, to find landlords who are willing to take a risk and potentially lose some profit in order to give someone a chance to reintegrate into the community.\nJust two weeks ago, we helped move a 66-year-old gentleman with co-occurring disorders, HIV, and a 10+ year-plus history of homelessness, into brand new affordable senior housing. He was so happy to be in his own place for the holidays.\nI am so proud of the Berkeley community of providers who have all been working under difficult circumstances. I look forward to this time next year when, hopefully, I can report that we have housed most of the 83 people who are currently in \"housing search\" and that we have brought another 80 high priority individuals into the housing search process. We remain committed to serving, learning, improving, and housing people.\nBerkeley Food & Housing Project was founded in 1970 and, in addition, to running the  Hub on behalf of the City of Berkeley, operates a free community meal , a men's and a women's shelter, family transitional housing, veteran transitional housing , and a permanent supportive housing program for formerly homeless adults with severe mental disabilities. All of these programs are located in Berkeley. In addition, BFHP runs a three-county rapid rehousing program aimed at preventing and ending veteran homelessness.\n*2015 Alameda County Homeless Count\nRelated:\nProtesters criticize Berkeley homeless services center (10.07.16)\nBerkeley seeks to house those most in need at The Hub (06.29.16)\nBerkeleyside welcomes submissions of op-ed articles.

Patty Delaluna and Officer Matt McGee offered insight into the main gangs in Berkeley, the history of local gangs, dynamics that have sparked recent violence, and more. The meeting was organized by the Berkeley Safe Neighborhoods Committee (BSNC), which has monthly sessions at BPD on public safety subjects such as shootings in Berkeley, drinking at Cal, youth violence and more.\nAbout 20 local residents attended the meeting, and pledged to take information back to their neighborhoods after officers answered questions about the topic at hand. Councilwoman Cheryl Davila, who showed up late, remarked that nearly no one in the room had come to her violence prevention meeting a few days earlier, and said that's where the community's efforts should be.\n\"It just kind of saddens me to hear this kind of talk because, in a way, it sounds racist, discriminatory,\" she said. \"I'm just speaking the truth right now, from what I just heard.\" Her comments echoed disagreements that have cropped up repeatedly in online forums like Nextdoor, where residents worried about crime have clashed with those who say such discussions inflame racial tensions and promote stereotypes and profiling.\n\nOthers in the room Monday said their hope is to find ways to curtail criminal behavior, not demonize a particular demographic group. Some residents spoke about city programs and summer jobs available to youth, and said they want to increase them. Officers emphasized efforts they have made to build relationships and connect at-risk youth and their families to resources -- which Berkeley does have -- and said the success stories have stuck with them over the years. The failures have made an impact, too.\n\"Those of us who are really entrenched in the work, we just want to save these kids. We want to stop it,\" said Sgt. Delaluna after the meeting. \"There was a kid I knew since he was 4 years old, and I watched him bleed out. That just devastates me. It's not what we want to see, but we know this is the outcome of this type of lifestyle. That's why we made it our life's work to stop this behavior.\"\nSgt.

Photo: Emilie RagusoDelaluna has been credited by many in the police department for her decades-long effort to understand Berkeley gangs, particularly the ones with Hispanic ties. She used to work on the project with another officer, Stephanie Polizziani, who left BPD for Benicia PD last year. Both have qualified as experts to testify in court about Berkeley gang activity. Delaluna has spoken privately about gangs to other agencies in law enforcement and educational settings, but this past week was her first session for the general public. On the eve of her retirement, expected later this year, Police Chief Andy Greenwood said Delaluna would be irreplaceable, and described her commitment and legacy as \"tremendous.\" Many at the meeting expressed appreciation for the department's apparent transparency.\n\"I've been involved for a long time in the city, and you let a whole lot of new information out,\" former Berkeley Mayor Shirley Dean, who runs the BSNC group, told Delaluna. \"Other chiefs ... denied there were gangs in Berkeley. We are now coming to the realization that there are gangs in Berkeley, and they go back many years.\"\nPolice said, to keep it in perspective, most of the crime in Berkeley isn't gang-related. At the same time, they agreed that reducing gang activity would lead to less crime. No hard numbers were presented at the meeting but, at a BSNC meeting last fall, a Berkeley homicide sergeant said at least nine of the year's 25 shootings, to that point, were believed to be gang-related. And the vast majority of the known shooters were adults. Part of the issue is that BPD does not track gang members, or gang-related crime, in a comprehensive manner.\nLearn more about \"prison gangs\" in this program shot at Santa Rita JailIn fact, BPD has said little about gangs for years. In late 2013, when BPD acknowledged that Strawberry Creek Park was \"occasionally frequented by Berkeley-based gang members,\" it was the department's first public reference to gangs in quite some time. Several months later, BPD identified two men police said threw glass bottles at an officer as West Side Berkeley gang members. In recent months, the tide may have begun to shift, as police have noted gang ties in court papers related to more than one arrest. But the department typically withholds gang names so, it says, to give them less legitimacy. In spite of that stance, Chief Greenwood, who himself has declined recently to name gangs in public, made no move to limit Monday's detailed discussion.\nDelaluna said she believes it's important for people to know the names of the gangs to understand the dynamics in their neighborhoods.\n\"If you name a gang, it actually gives power to the community,\" she said. \"You name the gang and you educate the community.\" She said after the meeting: \"It's like abuse in a family. If you don't talk about it, you can't do anything about it.\"\nGangs? In Berkeley?\nDelaluna got her start in Berkeley in the 90s working first for the city running programs in San Pablo Park. After several years, she became a police officer, and was one of just two Spanish-speaking officers at the time, she said. Early on, she began learning about a gang called West Side Berkeley, or WSB, that hung out at Strawberry Creek and James Kenney parks. She learned it was a Norteno gang tied to the Nuestra Familia prison gang. Norteno, or \"Northerner,\" gangs are known to do the street work for the prison gang, she said. Its members have been linked to serious violent crimes including murder attempts, robberies and assaults. The most serious case in Berkeley in recent years is that of WSB member Krishna Ferreira, who is facing charges in a 2013 homicide outside Bing's Liquors that authorities say was gang-related.\nDelaluna said WSB goes back to the late 70s, when it began simply as a club, which is not uncommon. In the 80s, she said, some of its members began smoking marijuana and getting involved with criminal activity. Discussion among members followed, and the group's criminal element ended up keeping the name, she said. In addition to the parks, gang members also hung out on the U.S. Post Office steps downtown wearing the color red to \"show their colors.\"\nGang membership, she noted, is not a crime. But committing crimes for the benefit of a gang is illegal. Delaluna said the department has been able to do a lot of work -- using stay-away orders and gang enhancements to push for stricter sentencing -- to discourage WSB members from committing crimes in Berkeley. If a gang member was a minor, the officers would hold him -- to get him away from the gang -- until his parents could come. When she's met with parents, Delaluna said she walks them through her research to give them a better understanding of what their child might be involved with.\nWSB graffiti -- which sometimes includes the Roman numeral XIV, or X4, a reference to the \"N\" (the 14th letter of the alphabet) in Norteno -- has been a frequent sight, even in recent years, on the west side of town. Delaluna described efforts working with neighbors around Strawberry Creek Park, which had numerous shootings and apparent gang activity nearby, to educate them and clean up the area to make it more family-friendly. Those efforts have largely worked, Delaluna said. Over the years, she estimates she's counted perhaps 300 WSB members and associates. There may be 40-50 who are still \"somewhat active,\" but most have left Berkeley, she said.\nWest Side Berkeley, or WSB, gang graffiti appears in a variety of places on the west side of town. This was spotted in January 2014 on Sixth Street north of Allston Way. Photo: Emilie RagusoBerkeley has in the past also seen some Southerner, or Sureno, gang members who claim the letter 13 (XIII) and are allied with the Mexican Mafia prison gang, she said. Some have gone by \"BST\" or \"Berkeley South Trece,\" but there has been little activity from them in recent times. Delaluna said, back in the 90s, a Sureno student stabbed and killed a Norteno one, but the Norteno prevalence at Berkeley High essentially knocked out the competition. In more recent times, some local residents have said they are part of the Border Brothers, or \"BB,\" a Hispanic gang in Oakland that's separate from the Nortenos and Surenos. But they haven't been very active in Berkeley, either.\nDelaluna and Officer McGee explained how the landscape of Berkeley gangs has changed significantly over the years. In the past, gangs were largely made up of a single racial group; now there are \"hybrid\" gangs with members of different races. Territory, down to the block, used to be a huge issue -- and Oakland still uses maps to track gang activity -- but the situation in Berkeley has become more fluid, the officers said. That's not to say the neighborhood doesn't matter: Berkeley gangs still claim the South and West parts of town. But gang members are much less likely to be \"posting up on the block\" in large groups the way they used to in the 90s and early 2000s, Delaluna said. And, today, social media is playing a greater and greater role in gang disputes and in how people actually identify as members of those groups.\n\"In the past it was the turf area,\" Officer McGee said. \"That's really not so much the case anymore. It's more about who you're communicating with and following on social media, and who the groups are that you align with.\"\nSocial media plays key role in \"beef\" online\nSeveral incidents of violence police have linked to Berkeley gang members in recent years have been sparked or exacerbated by posts on social media. An Instagram photo disrespecting Jermaine Davis, just after he was shot to death in Berkeley in 2013, may have contributed to a \"rampage of violence\" that left a little girl dead in Oakland, and a slew of other victims. Davis was identified as a leader in West Berkeley's Waterfront -- or H20 -- gang, though some who knew him said he had gotten his life in order shortly before his death and was trying to get younger family members on track. That same year, disrespectful social media posts may have led to the incarceration of four other men with Waterfront ties on allegations of a \"murder plot\" in Oakland.\nWhen Waterfront members get incarcerated, Delaluna said, they affiliate with the Kumi, or Kumi 415, prison gang. The Black Guerrilla Family, founded in San Quentin prison in 1966, also has members in Berkeley; the father of the man sentenced to death for the revenge killing above -- Darnell Williams Jr. -- was a BGF member when his son was growing up. Officer Polizziani, testifying in court in 2014 on a Berkeley murder case, noted that WSB is somewhat unique because it shares territory with Waterfront, which has been active in the neighborhood around Eighth and Camelia streets in West Berkeley.\n\nIn 2015, the \"new generation\" of Waterfront members, who call themselves \"Babas,\" took to social media to burn a picture of 14-year-old Davon Ellis after he was killed in Oakland, Delaluna said. That prompted a wave of online beefing, and drew numerous Oakland students into Berkeley to push back. In those events, which authorities have called \"wildings,\" more than 100 youth turned up repeatedly to Berkeley streets, resulting in injuries, confiscated weapons and arrests. The first wilding actually took place in 2014, Delaluna said, and she eventually learned that dueling school football teams were responsible for much of the brouhaha. She went on to work with the Oakland Unified School District to identify involved Oakland students and meet with their parents to nip some of that activity in the bud.\n\"The last thing I want to see is kids go this route. I want them to be successful and change the world in a positive way,\" she said. \"I'm always willing to give a kid a chance, but if that kid is hurting another kid, then I don't have a choice. There are consequences to that.\"\nGang research crosses city lines\nSpeaking of Oakland, Delaluna said a lot of the gang members BPD contacts in Berkeley actually live in Oakland. And some of the shootings that happen in Oakland are done by \"Berkeley gangsters.\" So she ends up spending a fair amount of time working with Oakland on those cases, she said. Any given month, she estimated, 50-100 gang members are contacted by police in Berkeley, but many of those could be from other cities. She said hard numbers are elusive because the department doesn't track them. Delaluna's gang research has been an ancillary duty when she can find time outside her main assignment as a patrol supervisor.\nAfter the 2015 wildings, Delaluna said, she realized through her digging that some members of the Babas were actually the children of Waterfront members. Initially, police considered the Babas more of a \"disruptive group,\" not a gang, but research made it clear to her that its members had access to weapons and criminal aspirations. The gang has also identified as \"B.O.H,\" or \"Bros Over Hoes,\" Delaluna said. Members of the group started out with crimes such as prowling, trespassing and burglary, and moved on to more serious ones like robbery. They range from about 17 or 18 to their early 20s at this point. There may be 20 members of the group. But, again, it's hard to know for sure.\n\"They have many who will say they are but, in reality, they just claim [gang membership on social media],\" Delaluna said. \"But they don't really do anything but get high.\"\n\nIn November 2015, Delaluna heard rumors that indicated a rift had occurred where older gang members were requiring youth to \"choose sides\" between South and West Berkeley. That's when 16-year-old Sultan Bey, now deceased, was left in critical condition with major head trauma after being stomped by a group of other teens. His mother told the media at that time that he was told to choose a side, but refused. \"He was asked to choose a side to be on and he was like, 'I'm not choosing a side because I'm not in this. I don't know what you want me to do but I'm friends with everybody,'\" his mother told ABC 7.\nAfter that, Delaluna said a number of South Berkeley youth began calling themselves \"Ls,\" and making an \"L\" sign to identify with each other. In response, Babas were posting photographs where they would make the \"L\" sign upside down to show disrespect. Disses went back and forth on social media, but alliances remained fluid, with various people \"bouncing back and forth\" between both groups from one day to the next. One day, about a year ago, Delaluna said she came across a diss video posted online. She told patrol she had a feeling there could be retribution. The next day, three teens were shot in a car on Parker Street, though they all survived. One of the young men who was shot, Aaron Meredith, has been identified as a Baba and was recently charged in connection with two shootings in South Berkeley in December.\nDelaluna said the \"Ls\" name could reference the phrase \"Take no losses,\" and may also pay homage to a friend of theirs who was killed: \"Long Live Larry.\" Before the Ls, the 5 Finga Mafia was active in South Berkeley and North Oakland starting in perhaps 2013. Local gang members once called their territory \"2800 Krakk Street\" because they claimed San Pablo Park, she said, at 2800 Park St. \"Way back in the day, they used to deal crack at this park,\" Delaluna said. \"They eventually morphed into the 5 Finga Mafia and originally claimed it was their rap label, but they and other gangs now refer to them always as 5 Finga Mafia. They are aligned with NSO or North Side Oakland and several will also not only claim 5 Finga but Campbell Village Gangsters or CVG, an Oakland gang.\"\n\nDelaluna said the Ls are Berkeley's \"youngest generation of kids\" who associate themselves with gang life. But she said they are \"not necessarily the hardened or brazen gangsters ... they just rap about it.\" Unlike other groups, Ls generally use their music to promote South Berkeley rather than criticize other neighborhoods. She said members of the Ls overlap with the rap collective \"MBK,\" or \"My Brother's Keeper,\" though Ls who have appeared in MBK videos are not out causing violence. Some have been targeted, she said. And some in the background of the videos, according to Delaluna, \"do live the violent life of gangs and closely associate with the 5 Finga Mafia.\" (In addition, three members of the Ls are facing gun charges after a fight in March.)\nFor those whose heads are spinning, she said Monday night, it's only natural given the complexity of the dynamics and relationships. It's taken her an entire career to amass the knowledge she's acquired.\n\"Grasping gang names, alliances and such is really quite complicated and can be fluid depending on the generation,\" she said. \"The reality of it is, identifying a gang is much more complicated than just a one-time stop on the street or types of clothing or tattoos. It's an evolved process that takes time.\"\nPolice: \"Everybody's a rapper and every rapper wants to be a gangster\"\nFrom her research, Delaluna said, Berkeley youth aren't drawn so much to gangs anymore out of a need for protection, or because of poverty. It's simply become the most appealing social group for some. She said the Bay Area is a national hub for underground hip hop, and some youth have been talented and lucky enough to get rich just by posting their music on sites like YouTube and SoundCloud. Many of the youth are trying to make it big by rapping about gangster life.\n\"Everybody's a rapper and every rapper wants to be a gangster,\" she said. \"Most of them are not actually getting in trouble with the cops. They graduate high school with decent grades. But they're rappers. And they rap that lifestyle, and they get caught up in that. And then what you have is, behind them, friends they grew up with that are kind of marginalized flashing guns.\"\n\nAdded McGee: \"I don't get the sense that they're breaking the law for a means of money or capitalism or anything like that. I get the sense that they're doing it for the likes on social media.... I don't see them 'paying taxes' [to a prison gang], at least the group that I deal with.... This is the direct threats on social media: going after one person in particular for the actions that they've done on social media.\"\nMcGee spends the bulk of his shift at BPD as the school resource officer at Berkeley High. The city used to have officers at the middle schools, too, but that program fell apart due to lack of funding. Last year, the department sought funding to put a school resource officer at Berkeley Technology Academy (BTA), but the School Board opposed the plan. Some school officials have said putting police in schools will traumatize youth and result in criminalization at an earlier age. The police department's position -- with support from the school superintendent and former BTA principal -- has been that creating a strong relationship between an officer and at-risk students is actually better for youth in the long run.\nSgt. Spencer Fomby, who worked in South Berkeley as a beat officer and was on the Drug Task Force before it was disbanded, said intervention and building relationships with those in the streets is a big part of the work BPD has done. Fomby said he's been heartened to see youth who heard him speak at twilite basketball come up to him and let him know they're now in college, now have jobs. But other times, the end result is not so good, and a shooting or prison is the outcome. Over the years, he said, he's seen a wide range of family dynamics.\n\"There are extremes. We have families that raise their kids to be gang members. It is shocking,\" Fomby said. \"And all the way up to kids whose family lived in Hercules, lived with both parents, a great family, and they're coming to me like, 'My kid is in the street, he wants to be a gang member. He lives in the suburbs, but he's coming here to Berkeley to participate in gangs. Help us save our kid.'\"\nPolice responded to numerous youth fights that drew scores of youth into Berkeley from Oakland in 2014 and 2015. Photo: Siciliana TrevinoMcGee said he regularly meets with, and texts, parents of students to try to build that bridge home to make sure youth are where they're supposed to be, particularly when problems arise. But parents often say they feel hopeless when they get his calls.\n\"They're appreciative. They're responsive,\" he said. \"But you're dealing with a 14-, 15-, 16-year-old. They're so far along already. And unfortunately we've got them now at this stage and, we're trying, but sometimes that gang, that group that they're associating with, has already got them.\" \nMcGee, who majored in social work at UC Berkeley and was in juvenile probation for years before getting hired at BPD, said he strives to avoid labeling -- known to have a negative impacts on youth -- but will go to parents if he has evidence and facts to make his case. Some parents, who have histories of their own with law enforcement, have told him they want a better life for their children. But they've told McGee their attempts to keep their kids out of trouble have fallen short.\nRacial inequity makes crime conversations perilous\nBPD's relationship with BUSD has been challenged over the years. There have been repeated conversations about collaboration, but it's unclear whether progress has been made. There have been disputes about what information can legally be shared between the institutions. In 2011, then-Police Chief Michael Meehan said the school district had made it clear it wouldn't call BPD if there was a robbery on campus. The national political dialogue about race has added another layer of complexity. Delaluna recalled a meeting with school officials, shortly after the 2014 Black Lives Matter protests in Berkeley, where police tried to bring up the Babas, a black gang, and hit a roadblock.\n\"Nobody wanted to hear it. We said, we're bringing this up because that's where the problem is right now. It's not by choice. We don't look for the race,\" she said. Delaluna said BPD focused on West Side Berkeley (a Hispanic gang) when it was causing problems, and another group, the 510 Clown Mob (a hybrid gang that's mostly white) when it was making trouble downtown. \"And, when it was the Babas, we needed to deal with them. It's such a hard discussion for the school and the city to have.\"\nThe remarks about racism and discrimination, by Councilwoman Davila, reflected that position. Attendee Laura Menard -- a longtime South Berkeley public safety advocate who helped bring about Monday's meeting -- said at the meeting that she finds the unwillingness in Berkeley to discuss crime, its causes and solutions, deeply disturbing. And she said that puts too many kids, who are raised to underestimate the risks of gangs and criminal behavior, in danger.\n\"I find it immoral and outrageous that we're not naming the problem and shaming the problem more directly as a society -- because we have kids that don't understand the level of threat that they can be on the perimeters of. And they can be the one that becomes the victim,\" Menard said. \"We're not going to be, as a society, taking responsibility for the fact that there's a lot of young people and adults with guns prepared to get into beefs over stuff that's nothing. Nothing.\"\nShe mentioned two young Berkeley High grads killed last summer when they were caught in the crossfire at a birthday party at a downtown Oakland club. Days earlier, another Berkeley High grad was killed in an Oakland shooting that her mother said was aimed at someone else. In 2014, a young woman with a bright future who had just graduated from Berkeley Technology Academy was killed in Oakland during a shooting in a Wendy's parking lot; her boyfriend was also shot but reportedly survived.\nMenard said it's youth like those, brought up in Berkeley to dismiss potential danger signs in the interest of the city's entrenched social justice philosophy, that she is most concerned about. Menard has pushed hard for \"school-linked probation services,\" in place in other counties like Contra Costa, to keep a closer eye from an earlier age on youth who've run into problems. The idea, she said, is to track attendance, grades and behavior in a more robust way to produce more meaningful results. Menard describes the approach as progressive. She also noted local efforts that have worked in the past to use city code enforcement to target problem properties, where criminals gather, to break up those hotspots.\nStudents acted out a scene about a robbery over a pair of shoes as part of a 2013 anti-gun-violence assembly at Berkeley High. Photo: Emilie RagusoShe and Delaluna said other cities have effectively used a technique known as \"call-ins\" to have intensive sit-downs with the community members causing the most violence: to lay out their options in a room alongside pastors, attorneys, law enforcement, community organizations and more, and get them to cease and desist their crimes, or else. Berkeley hasn't taken that approach. Meeting attendees said it could be useful in Berkeley, and that they'd like to see \"scared straight\" talks, youth employment, a bigger budget for youth recreation programs, and more.\nThe city has no single resource for those seeking programs for disadvantaged youth. But meeting attendees brought up Berkeley Youth Alternatives (BYA) and the Young Adult Project (YAP) as two reliable options. YAP is run out of the MLK Jr. Youth Services Center, at 1730 Oregon St. by Grove Park, and has a popular boxing program, and twilite basketball, along with many other options described as \"meaningful recreation experiences that include tutoring, violence prevention, and leadership development components for teens and young adults.\" In late February, the city announced its summer job program for youth (paying $10.50 an hour), and held several free resume workshops last month.\nSeveral attendees said neighborhood watch groups, and modern technology, continue to be an effective way to share information with each other and with police. But that's not always enough. Sherri Kaiser spoke on behalf of residents around San Pablo Park who were concerned about repeated gunfire in the neighborhood -- and a fatal shooting -- that began last year and continued into 2017. She said the situation was exacerbated by the silence from BPD: \"It was very distressing. Not just that it was going on, but that we didn't know what was going on.\"\nShe said Monday's meeting helped fill in some of those gaps, but hoped more information about how to identify gangs could be made available. Delaluna suggested simple Google searches, for terms like gang names and \"gangs in Berkeley,\" along with academic classes and books, as ways to learn more. And the officers said that, while gangs are an issue, a broader perspective may be useful on a daily basis for those with safety concerns.\n\"We all agree that the crime here in Berkeley is not 100% gang-related,\" said Officer Brandon Smith, area coordinator in Northeast Berkeley. \"So let's look for suspicious activity, criminal behavior. Don't seek out the gangs per se.\"\nPerhaps it's someone riding up and down the block on a bike who appears to be acting as a lookout. Or maybe you see people \"looking into cars more carefully than you would when you're on a walk,\" he said. Getting several calls from the same neighborhood night after night is likely to produce results.\nDelaluna concurred: \"It's knowing your neighbors. It really is knowing your community and your beat cop.\"\nThe Berkeley Safe Neighborhoods Committee is an umbrella organization for neighborhood watch groups around the city. It meets monthly at BPD and has a Facebook page. Have a public safety concern in your neighborhood?

Authorities have said little, but witness reports and records online have helped provide some insight into what took place.\nRead more about shootings in BerkeleyThe incident happened nearly two weeks ago, just after 10 p.m. on Friday, March 17, in the food court at 2519 Durant Ave. The area is a popular spot with UC Berkeley students because campus is nearby and many of the options are affordable with late-night hours. A witness told Berkeleyside photographer David Yee, who went to the scene in response to broadcasts over the police radio, that the shooting took place inside Gypsy's Trattoria Italiano.\nPolice have declined to confirm the location of the incident, or even that a shooting took place, but an arriving officer said on the radio that there was a bullet hole in the ceiling of 2519 Durant.\nThe witness told Yee he'd seen a young man in the restaurant with several young women just prior to the shooting. The witness heard a ruckus, then what sounded like glass breaking, but did not hear an actual gunshot. The young man then ran outside and was bleeding from the leg.\n\nAnother witness told Berkeleyside, \"I saw the majority of activity in front of Gypsy Trattoria, and also further down the street on the corner of Bowditch and Durant.\" He continued: \"People there I encountered said that a man was sitting at a table eating pasta, and accidentally shot himself with a gun. He then left and headed towards Bowditch and Durant, on the north side, and collapsed. Fire truck and ambulance arrived shortly after police.\"\nPolice responded to the Southside neighborhood for a shooting, but later released few details.

At this stage it is too early to tell the cause of the injury.\" Since then, no further information has been provided despite repeated requests.\nBerkeleyside consulted multiple online crime data sites, including records posted by CrimeMapping, the Alameda County sheriff's office and BPD's own open data portal, to learn more. The search revealed that authorities, in fact, quickly made an arrest in connection with the March 17 shooting.\nDemonte Dansby was arrested at 1:12 a.m. March 18, several hours after the shooting, on suspicion of carrying a loaded firearm in public, carrying a concealed firearm, and willful discharge of firearm in a negligent manner. He has since been charged with those felonies. Online records from the sheriff's office allege that the gun Dansby fired was unregistered.\nDansby remains in custody on $100,000 bail at Santa Rita Jail in Dublin.\nAccording to his Facebook page, Dansby attended Berkeley High and, later, Oakland Technical Senior High. His Facebook page says he is originally from Berkeley but was living in Oakland at the time of the arrest.\nDansby is scheduled for a pretrial hearing Monday at 9:15 a.m. at the Rene C.

Image: Google MapsBerkeleyside broke the news Sunday about two men tied to a Berkeley bank robbery in February. Monday, authorities said the men -- brothers from Oakland with felony records -- have actually been tied to five Bay Area bank robberies dating back to November.\nIn all five cases, an armed robber wearing a security guard uniform demanded money from the banks, which were in Berkeley, Oakland, Fremont and Alameda. According to court papers, the duo netted more than $40,000 from the heists. One of the brothers, 53-year-old Russell Bartlow, has a prior conviction from 1999 for armed bank robbery, which sent him to prison.\nBerkeley investigators became aware of the case in February when a man with a gun in a security guard uniform robbed a bank on Solano Avenue. The man wore a distinctive security jacket, described by police as black with a gold embroidered badge. He approached one of the tellers and demanded cash at gunpoint, BPD said in a prepared statement Monday. The man then ran off down Colusa Avenue and police were unable to catch him.\nAs they worked the case, detectives learned about three other \"similar\" robberies, according to court papers obtained by Berkeleyside. The first one took place Nov. 19 in Oakland at a Chase branch, followed by the robbery of an Alameda Citibank on Dec. 10, and a robbery at Bank of the West in Oakland on Jan. 23.\n\nPolice said they were able to piece together suspect and vehicle description from witness statements and security footage. That led them to zero in on a White Dodge Challenger identified by police as the \"getaway car.\" OPD stopped the Challenger in January for a vehicle code violation, and because it had been linked to the robberies, police said. Ultimately, that day, OPD let the driver, 36-year-old Jerron Bartlow, leave with a warning.\nInvestigators continued to look into the younger Bartlow, learning about his movements, vehicles and associates, according to court papers. At one point, detectives saw an older man park a Toyota outside the younger man's home, in the 2000 block of 100th Avenue in Oakland, and let himself inside with a key. Police found out that the registered owner of the Toyota was Russell Bartlow, and found that a prior booking photograph \"showed that he looked very similar to the suspect seen on the security video\" from one of the Oakland cases. Investigators also learned, at that time, that the elder Bartlow was on federal probation for bank robbery.\nPolice looked deeper into the Bartlows and learned they had both been on days off from work during four of the five robberies. In the other case, there was a two-hour gap between a robbery and the start of Russell Bartlow's work day, police wrote.\nOn March 18, BPD became aware of a fifth bank robbery, this time in Fremont, \"with the same described suspect wearing the same Security guard uniform armed with a silver semi-automatic handgun,\" police wrote in court papers.\nLast week Wednesday, Berkeley investigators served a search warrant on 100th Avenue, at a residence identified in court papers as the home of both brothers. During the search, police said they found a security guard jacket, black pants and black shoes, and two handguns, \"all items consistent with what Russell used during the commission of the Bank Robberies,\" police wrote.\nDuring police interviews, investigators say Jerron Bartlow admitted that a masked man in a security guard uniform -- seen in surveillance footage -- looked like his brother, though the younger Bartlow himself denied being involved in any robberies.\nThe men have been charged by the Alameda County district attorney's office with 13 felonies including armed robbery, use or possession of a firearm by a felon, and possession of heroin for sale. (Jerron Bartlow is facing fewer armed robbery charges, and no drug charges.)\nThe younger Bartlow has one prior conviction, in 2009 in Alameda County, for possession of cocaine base for sale.\nHis older brother has seven felony convictions dating back to 1985 related to drug sales, commercial burglary, robbery and armed bank robbery. The most recent conviction was in 1999.\nThe elder Bartlow, whose listed occupation is a student, is being held on a combined $2.22 million bail. The younger Bartlow, a truck driver, is being held on $410,000 bail, according to online records from the Alameda County sheriff's office. They are being held at Santa Rita Jail and were scheduled for arraignment Monday.\nThe men are set to enter pleas April 10 at 9 a.m. at the Rene C. Davidson Courthouse in Oakland.\nIn its prepared statement, BPD thanked the FBI as well as investigators from Oakland, Alameda and Fremont, \"for the teamwork\" which led to the arrests.\nMonday, BPD spokesman Sgt. Andrew Frankel described bank robberies in the city as \"very infrequent.\"\n\"It just doesn't happen here all that often anymore,\" he said.\n", "Coder Initials": "LN", "Title": "Brothers charged after 5 bank robberies", "Tags": "['Bank robbery', 'Berkeley crime', 'Berkeley Police', 'Berkeley robberies', 'Guns in Berkeley', 'North Berkeley', 'Public safety', 'Solano Avenue']", "Sections": "['Crime', 'Crime', 'Crime & Safety']", "Natural Language Location": "Chase Bank, Solano Ave", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.891258", "Zip Code": "94707", "ID": "252811", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.277908", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/27/brothers-charged-5-bank-robberies-berkeley-oakland-fremont-alameda/", "Author": "Emilie Raguso", "Date": "2017-03-27T18:25:07-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Berkeley has had at least 28 robberies in the past month, according to CrimeMapping.com.In the past month, Berkeley police officers have arrested a dozen people in connection with robberies around the city, with the most recent incident early Saturday just outside the police station.

Two of those cases involved possession for sale of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine, and possession of firearms, and the other was a gun case from Contra Costa County. Beamon's listed occupation is a security guard.\nLast week Thursday, at about 7 p.m., Sgt.

In the first case, at a market, a store clerk and customers narrowly escaped injury, police said, though one person in a nearby car was injured by glass fragments. In the second, a sleeping child was cut by flying glass. Both shootings caused significant alarm in the community, drawing hundreds to a meeting at San Pablo Park in January.\nMeredith, police said in the annual crime report to City Council last week, entered a \"no contest\" plea for illegal gun possession from the Jan. 19 prowling case in North Berkeley, and got a four-month jail sentence.\nBallistics tests then determined that the handgun he had during his arrest was the same one used in shootings at Sacramento Market and on Ward Street in December. On March 9, the Alameda County district attorney's office charged Meredith with both incidents, police announced last week.\n\nPolice say Aaron Meredith (right) is a \"known gang member\" in Berkeley.

The shooter fled, but police found six shell casings at the scene, and a community member who was sitting in a vehicle, and was struck in the face by shattering glass, identified the shooter as Meredith.\nFour days later, at about 11 p.m., two males got out of a car and shot at a person standing in front of a home in the 1400 block of Ward.\n\"At least one of the bullets went through a second floor bedroom window where two children were sleeping,\" police said, and one of them, a 5-year-old boy, was cut in the head by flying glass debris, according to court papers.

His bail has been set at $1,025,000. He is set to enter a plea in the new case April 5.\nMeredith has now been charged with nine felonies: five counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, in connection with shooting at three men and two women, two counts of shooting at an occupied vehicle, and two counts of shooting at an inhabited dwelling, according to court papers.\nMeredith also goes by the name \"Vonnie,\" or \"Lil Vonnie,\" on social media. He and friends posted a music video last year identifying as \"Babas.\" The group has previously been identified by authorities as a Berkeley gang.\nMeredith was arrested in Berkeley in 2015, along with a group of other young men, after an attack that left one teen in critical condition. (The victim, Sultan Bey, was killed in North Oakland earlier this month.) Police ultimately released the young men and no charges were filed.\nPolice also picked up Meredith, along with two other young men from Berkeley, in January 2016 in connection with a shooting on Russell Street between Sacramento and McGee.

Officers from both agencies took up a position on the roof, and an Oakland officer who had a rapport with the man was able to talk him into turning himself in. According to law enforcement sources, the man's pregnant girlfriend, who was in the vehicle with him during the chase, was taken to the hospital for observation.\nAs of about 9:30 p.m., College remained closed from Webster to Russell streets. Ashby Avenue was closed from Piedmont to Benvenue avenues.\n\nThe incident began at 6:50 p.m. in Oakland at 14th and Harrison streets, OPD said, when an officer put out an emergency broadcast about having been rammed by someone in a vehicle. Police said the officer had tried to make a felony vehicle stop, but the driver fled, traveling through various parts of Oakland before ending up in Berkeley at Ashby and College avenues at around 7:30 p.m.\nAn OPD staffer said the officer was expected to survive and may have broken a wrist, but that the investigation was still preliminary as of shortly before 9 p.m. Police reported just before 9:20 p.m. that a white Dodge truck on scene had been stolen from a dealership. Police also recovered a loaded, stolen firearm during the investigation.

Photo: Lance KnobelPolice searched this stolen truck after taking a man into custody on College Avenue on Wednesday. Photo: Lance KnobelWednesday evening, many Berkeleyside readers -- who were alarmed when police officers flooded the Elmwood neighborhood, as a helicopter hovered overhead -- wondered what was happening. A Berkeley Police spokesman told Berkeleyside shortly before 8 p.m. that a suspect had \"fled into our city\" but that it was an Oakland Police call, and that any additional information would need to come from that agency.\nBerkeleyside's Lance Knobel, who went out to investigate, saw at least eight police cars in the area and watched as officers set up a perimeter. Many of the officers had guns drawn. Three vehicles, including a white truck, had collided at the intersection of College and Ashby, but the cause of the crash was not immediately available.\nA woman named Madison, who said she saw the crash from about 10 feet away, said a man immediately jumped out of the truck and fled down Ashby. Perhaps 10-15 seconds later, a woman got out of the passenger side and started running away.\n\"The truck and the car hit head-on,\" she said, and gasoline was spraying all over the road. \"People were scared it was going to ignite so they ran into the stores nearby. Everyone was yelling 'Get out of the cars!' so I wasn't surprised when the driver of the truck got out, but then he just booked it down the street.\"\nAccording to another witness, the passenger stashed a gun in a local wine shop before attempting to flee the scene, and was \"running north on College and was apprehended by police officers shortly after ditching the weapon.\"\n(Phil Barringer shared the following raw video from the scene. Although initial reports indicated the man was armed, a gun was recovered by police during the investigation before the man was taken into custody.) \n\nMany readers reported seeing more than a dozen police cruisers speeding up College and Stuart just prior to the collision. One person reported seeing 23 police vehicles pass by on Interstate 580. \"Never seen so many cops,\" wrote another.\nThe driver who fled from police took up a position on the roof of the building that houses Ici Ice Cream, and the block of College from Ashby to Russell was closed off to pedestrians and motorists. Police identified the building on the scanner as 2946 College, and said negotiators were on scene to interact with the man.\nAt around 8 p.m. police asked bystanders to leave the area near the Ashby-Russell block and to stay \"at least a block away\" from the perimeter. An officer told a journalist on the scene to \"stay away from the line of fire.\"\nAccording to scanner traffic, police on the ground recovered a gun in connection with the investigation, but said they did not initially know if the man was also armed.\nA witness, who gave his name as Andrew, told Knobel he had been parked across the street from Ici when police told the man on the roof to lift his shirt to show if he had \"any other weapons.\"\nThe man on the roof asked police if a woman was all right, and police responded that they \"couldn't do anything about that now.\"\nThree vehicles were involved in the crash.

The man said his son had been taken to Espresso Roma, at the same intersection, and did not have serious injuries but was shaken up.\nCouncilwoman Lori Droste was on the scene of the incident, too, said Knobel.\nBerkeley police issued a Nixle alert at 8:26 p.m. warning of police activity in the area of Ashby and College and alerting pedestrians and motorists to \"avoid the area until further notice.\"\nAs per the police scanner, Berkeley officers who were on a College Avenue rooftop were coordinating efforts with OPD and, as of 8:32 p.m., there had been \"no change.\"\nAt 8:35 p.m., Anita Coulter posted to Twitter from inside the Dailey Method fitness studio -- \"We're on Ashby btwn College & Benvenue. Most of us are waiting for car access. Safe and snug so far!\" -- after asking Berkeleyside and Councilwoman Droste whether it was safe to go outside. Another woman said she was stuck on a bus during the incident.\nPolice took the man into custody without incident just before 8:40 p.m. and were beginning to break down their perimeter posts and clear the area, as per scanner reports.\nAt 8:50 p.m. Knobel, who was observing from outside the perimeter, reported he could see people leaving Ici and Summer Kitchen Bake Shop next door as if they had just been allowed to go outside.\nRelief at being allowed to leave College Avenue store after active shooter incident on March 15.

It appears below in full.\nOn March 15, 2017, at approximately 6:50 p.m., an Oakland police unit consisting of two officers was conducting an investigative vehicle stop when they were intentionally struck by the vehicle they stopped. This incident occurred in the area of 14th Street and Harrison Street. The suspect vehicle was occupied by a driver and one passenger, both adults. From the collision, one officer suffered a broken wrist and was transported to a local hospital for medical treatment.\nAfter the police vehicle was struck, the suspect vehicle proceeded to flee the scene, which then prompted a vehicle pursuit by Oakland police units. The suspect vehicle was also known to contain a firearm.\nDuring the pursuit, the suspect vehicle led officers outside of Oakland city limits and from there, Oakland police air support and officers from other agencies, including the Alameda County Sheriff's Office, San Leandro Police Department, and Berkeley Police Department became involved.\nThe vehicle pursuit ended due to the suspect vehicle colliding with two, uninvolved civilian vehicles in Berkeley, in the area of College Avenue and Ashby Avenue. The two occupants of the suspect vehicle fled on foot after the collision. One suspect was quickly detained and arrested, along with a recovery of a stolen and loaded firearm.\nPolice units set a perimeter to narrow in on the location of the other suspect, who was soon after detained and arrested in the 2900 block of College Avenue.\nThe two suspects were transported to a local hospital for medical evaluation. No additional injuries have been reported at this time.\nThis is still an active investigation and anyone with information is encourage to contact the Oakland Police Department Felony Assault Unit at (510) 238-3426.\nThis story was updated throughout the evening due to the developing nature of events.\n", "Coder Initials": "LN", "Title": "Man arrested after officer in car rammed, police chase from Oakland to Berkeley", "Tags": "['Berkeley Police', 'Berkeley traffic accident', 'Car chase', 'College Avenue', 'Oakland Police Department', 'Public safety', 'The Elmwood', 'Traffic safety']", "Sections": "['Crime & Safety', 'Crime & Safety', 'Police']", "Natural Language Location": "College Ave and Ashby Ave", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8570436", "Zip Code": "94705", "ID": "251647", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2530418", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/15/berkeley-oakland-police-south-berkeley-active-investigation/", "Author": "Berkeleyside Editors", "Date": "2017-03-15T20:01:03-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Police recovered cash, drugs, evidence of drug sales and a gun during a recent warrant search.

Photo: Robert Couse-BakerFollowing last June's rally at the Sacramento Capitol by members of The Traditionalist Workers Party -- which turned violent after hundreds showed up to stop the white supremacist group's event, by any means necessary -- many wondered whether those who caused violence would face criminal prosecution.\nThat question quickly came up in Berkeley last year after BUSD middle school teacher Yvette Felarca was caught on video hitting someone at the rally while calling him a Nazi, and punching him in the stomach repeatedly while shouting for him to \"get the fuck off our streets.\"\nFelarca also was interviewed by the national media that day. When she was identified online as a Berkeley middle school teacher, critics of what they saw on video launched a petition to have her fired, and at least one person reportedly made threats to hurt children if she was allowed to remain at her school. In recent weeks, after Felarca again took a leadership role in a Berkeley protest against Milo Yiannopoulos, a new wave of outrage was directed at her, prompting an estimated 1,000 emails and calls to the Berkeley Unified School District and her middle school campus. Whether she will face charges tied to the Sacramento rally remains an open question, but authorities have said they are one step closer to making a determination about criminal prosecution overall. \nAuthorities in Sacramento have previously declined to comment on potential fallout from the rally, citing the ongoing investigation. The event resulted in 14 reported injuries as well as thousands of dollars in property damage on Capitol grounds. Now, the California Highway Patrol has announced it has finally completed a lengthy report implicating more than 100 people in a range of criminal acts. Next, the Sacramento County district attorney's office is slated to decide who, if anyone, will face charges.\n\nMonday, the Sacramento County district attorney's office said it won't make any decisions, or release any names, until it has had enough time for \"careful consideration\" of the CHP report. That report has not been made public.\n\"We are more interested in getting it right than in getting it fast,\" Shelly Orio, spokeswoman for the office, told Berkeleyside. Names of those facing charges will not be released until much further on in the process, after warrants for arrest have been approved and court dates have been set for arraignment.\n\nLast week, March 8, the Sacramento branch of the CHP announced it had concluded its investigation into the \"2016 Capitol incident,\" and sent its results to the DA's office. In a prepared statement, the CHP said the \"violent incident\" involved more than 300 people.\nIn a brief overview of events, the CHP said about two dozen people from \"The Traditionalist Workers Party\" had secured a permit for the June 26 rally at the Capitol. But they weren't alone.\n\"Other groups present that day -- and numbering in the hundreds -- did not have a permit and were there to prevent the permitted rally. The non-permitted groups confronted the permitted group, leading to violence, which resulted in 14 reported injuries and thousands of dollars in property damage on Capitol grounds,\" the CHP said.\nWhat followed was an eight-month investigation that resulted in a 2,000-page report based on hundreds of interviews and other evidence.

As I rushed home to my dad, all I could think of is, \"my sister is dead, my sister is dead, my sister is dead.\" That mantra ran through my frantic mind, as I tried to navigate traffic, and while absorbing the reality I would never see her alive again. I never got a chance to return her phone call two days before, I never got a chance to update her on the latest family gossip, and I never got a chance to keep her safe.\nPeople of color are more likely to be victims of police brutality, and the victim pool has expanded to include the mentally ill. What is shocking is the blatant under-reporting of these killings and or attacks. What we do know is that the numbers are increasing. Unfortunately, for any family, who has a mentally disabled child, sibling, parent, friend or relative...you cannot keep them safe. Your love, patience, dedication, and unconditional, unbreakable resolve will not save them from what I consider the biggest threat to their lives: the police. Many who are reading this will justifiably think how dramatic and unsubstantiated my reckless comments are, but here are the facts:\n\nNearly 8 million Americans suffer from a serious mental illness.\nOne in four fatal police encounters involve someone with mental illness.\nPeople with mental illness are 16 times more likely than others to be killed by police.\nDue to the nationwide lack of mental-health resources, the police are always the first responders to mental-health crisis calls.\nAbout 1.2 million people in state, local and federal custody reported some kind of mental-health problem. 64% of those are in jails, 56% are state prison inmates and 45% are in the federal prison system.\n\n35% of emergency calls in Berkeley are mental-health calls; and yet Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) has been trimmed down from a voluntary 40 hours of training, to now a mandatory eight-hour training, for all officers who are in direct contact with the public. The officers, who responded to Kayla's call for mental-health treatment, did not have Mobile Crisis (trained mental-health professionals) to assist with assessing Kayla. The officer ran a warrant check on Kayla, before she finally spoke to her, for approximately 5-7 minutes, before attempting to arrest her on an invalid, unconfirmed warrant, for someone with Kayla's birth name, yet, incorrect date of birth. Kayla committed no crime. She was not a danger to herself or others; however her roommate called for help because Kayla needed her medication. Kayla waited over two months to see a psychiatrist in Berkeley, and when she arrived at the clinic, she was turned away, as the provider was not available to see her.\nIn 2001 Amnesty International published a report called United States of America: Race, Rights and Police Brutality, which highlights \"the problem of police using excessive force, including deadly force, against mentally ill or disturbed people who could have been subdued through less extreme measures.\"\nThe trend of police arresting and criminalizing those in a mental-health crisis has deadly consequences. But why is it so hard to get justice when this happens? Why has one the most important federal laws, which was enacted to protect the rights of people with disabilities, including mental health disabilities, consistently been ignored and disregarded when it applies to law enforcement? And how does this happen in Berkeley, respected worldwide for disability rights?\nAfter four long years, we will finally see our day in court, as we move forward with the American with Disability Act (ADA) claim. Kayla Moore's court case is for all those who have a disability, and any way the court rules, that determination will have long term impacts on disability rights, and police accountability.\nFind more information about Kayla Moore's case and upcoming court dates. #Sayhername\n", "Coder Initials": "LN", "Title": "Op-ed: Kayla Moore, 4 years and counting...", "Tags": "['Berkeley Copwatch', 'Berkeley fatality', 'Berkeley Police', 'City of Berkeley', 'Kayla Moore', 'Public safety', 'Xavier Moore']", "Sections": "['Opinion', 'Opinion', 'Police']", "Natural Language Location": "Gaia Building", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8692135", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "248808", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2671214", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/21/op-ed-kayla-moore-4-years-counting/", "Author": "Guest contributor", "Date": "2017-02-21T11:00:20-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "I-80 freeway.

Photo: CourtesyExactly two weeks after the trial began, an Alameda County Superior Court jury found Anthony Durant guilty of gunning down his childhood friend Christian Sheppard during a dice game in South Berkeley in 2015.\nThe jury found Durant guilty last week of second-degree murder, along with unlawful firearm activity. He could face a sentence of 40 years to life.\nDurant himself took the stand in his own defense to describe how, he said, a masked gunman suddenly appeared to rob him and Sheppard but instead took Sheppard's life, while taking none of his many valuables: a gold Michael Kors watch on his wrist, $120 in his pocket or his diamond chain. The jury was not convinced and, after deliberating over several days for perhaps eight hours, brought back a guilty verdict last week Tuesday, Jan. 31.\n\"We got justice for Haylee and Lyric,\" said Robert Hunter, one of Sheppard's three older brothers, after the verdict came in. The two little girls are Sheppard's daughters. Sheppard's mother, and other family and friends, who attended the trial daily, said they would like to wait until after the March 24 sentencing to speak further to the media.\n\nChristian Sheppard in 2009, when he graduted from Berkeley High. Photo: CourtesyDefense attorney George Arroyo, with the Alameda County public defender's office, said there's more work to be done.\n\"Although I am disappointed by the result, I respect the jury's decision and look forward to filing an appeal,\" he said. Several members of Durant's family, including his mother and grandmother -- who attended the entire trial -- politely declined to comment outside the courtroom at the Rene C. Davidson Courthouse after the verdict had been read.\nJimmie Wilson, who prosecuted the case for the Alameda County district attorney's office, said he told the defendant's mother he took no pleasure in the conviction.\n\"I come from this community, and I hate to see the violence that we see over and over and over again,\" he said. \"These are two lives that are lost, and they're lost because of gun violence.\"\nDuring opening statements when the trial began Jan. 17, before Judge C. Don Clay, Wilson played Sheppard's call to 911 as he fought for his life behind a South Berkeley apartment building where he and friends frequently played dice. He's shouting and groaning, and -- though the audio was difficult to make out -- he struggled to say something like, \"I got shot.\"\nWilson described Sheppard's death as violent, gruesome and unnecessary, and said Durant \"executed his friend,\" firing 16 bullets at him. The type of gun used in the murder required the shooter to pull the trigger 16 times. The autopsy revealed 21 entry and exit wounds in Sheppard's body.\nAnthony Durant. Photo: BPD\"Anthony Durant is a murderer, pure and simple,\" Wilson said, during opening statements. \"The evidence will show he is a violent human being.... There was no other reason for this crime but his anger.\"\nSheppard and Durant met when they were children and remained friends and schoolmates throughout their lives. At the time of the shooting, they were both 24. There was some indication in court that there had been a recent falling out, perhaps over money, but minimal evidence to that end was presented.\nAccording to witness testimony, the young men met up earlier in the day with another friend to hang out, talk and smoke marijuana. They went by the Rosewood apartments, in the 1600 block of Russell Street, and met up with some other people for a regular dice game next door behind 1611 Russell. It's a good spot for a game because the location isn't visible from the street, and there are many ways to get in and out, including holes in the fence into the Rosewood complex where many of the players had ties.\nNone of the witnesses who testified said they saw the shooting itself. One neighbor, who knew Durant, said she saw him with Sheppard before and after the shooting, heard Durant talking in an angry voice just before the gunfire, and that Sheppard and Durant were alone together just before the shooting. She also saw Durant running away, past her window, right after shots were fired.\nNeighbors said it took some time for first responders to arrive. One estimated 15 minutes. In the meantime, people gathered outside at the Rosewood, screaming and crying as they tried to figure out what had taken place. One witness said she heard someone say, \"Christian, get up. Fight for your life!\" Other voices screamed Durant's name.\nChristian Sheppard (left) with his three older brothers in a memorial lanyard worn by the oldest brother, Will, during trial. Photo: Emilie RagusoKenneth Joubert, a 26-year-old father of three and Berkeley High graduate from 2009, testified he had been with Durant and Sheppard earlier in the day, and went with them to the dice game. He said he and another friend left the game before the shooting, but ran back when they heard gunfire.\nHe recalled yelling to Christian from the Rosewood, \"Get up, stand up, the ambulance is on its way!\" He remembered a lot of noise and confusion, and \"people in disbelief.\"\nHe told the jury he had become friends with Sheppard in sixth grade. In the summer, they would play basketball together in Ohlone Park. Joubert said Sheppard had been the friend who would convince him to stay when he wanted to cut school -- which was often.\n\"He helped you?\" prosecutor Wilson asked Joubert. \"In all sorts of different ways,\" Joubert replied.\nThe first 911 call about the shooting came in to the Berkeley Police Department at 8:32 p.m. on Oct. 6, 2015. The neighbor who made that call said she saw a man she believed, with 90% certainty, to be Durant. He was standing next to a body, which he later \"stepped over ... like he was a sack of potatoes,\" Wilson told the jury.\nSheppard was still alive when first responders got to the scene, but he could no longer speak and police were unable to take a dying declaration. There was a lot of blood. Around his body, they found a pair of dice, and a couple dollar bills. Crime scene photos show his arms flailed up, a bullet hole to his left eye. During the autopsy, the coroner found that bullet lodged in Sheppard's mouth, Wilson told the jury, along with six other bullets that remained in his body.\nA memorial sweatshirt for Christian Sheppard worn by one of his brothers during trial. Photo: Emilie RagusoThe night of the shooting, police found the murder weapon in a yard between the crime scene and Durant's family home on Julia Street. It was hidden, five doors down from Durant's home, under a chair in the yard of a neighbor Durant knew and had spent time with at least once, according to testimony. Durant said on the stand he wasn't the one who left the gun there.\nAfter witnesses identified Durant to police as the shooter on the night of the murder, police staked out his home and watched it, then took Durant into custody when he walked outside to smoke a joint in his backyard. During a search, police found cash with what was later determined to be Sheppard's blood on it in Durant's pocket. A gunshot residue test came back positive on both Durant's hands, according to court testimony.\nDefense attorney Arroyo told the jury that, though \"their life was less ambitious than most,\" Durant \"did not murder his childhood friend.\"\n\"He did what everybody else did,\" Arroyo said. \"He ran from the scene.... He is innocent of what he's accused of.\"\nArroyo described Durant's South Berkeley neighborhood as close-knit, and said the culture is such that people don't talk to police, don't hang around at a crime scene, and \"certainly don't kill your friends.\" Arroyo said the day of the shooting was an \"abnormally normal\" day of smoking marijuana, grabbing a bite to eat and playing dice in the usual spot.\n\"There's really nothing else for these kids to do,\" he told the jury. He said witnesses for the prosecution missed key moments and simply didn't see the masked robber who actually shot Sheppard.\nArroyo said Durant had gunshot residue on his hands because he \"lunged for the gun\" during the shooting, and tussled with the robber to keep himself from getting shot.\nNo one other than Durant, however, offered any testimony about seeing a masked robber or hearing anything that sounded like a robbery the night of the shooting.\nChristian Sheppard with longtime girlfriend Gabby on a trip to Las Vegas. The two dated for five years during college, and remained friends after they broke up. Photo: CourtesyAnother issue that came up in court was a letter Durant sent from jail, intercepted and then sent on by authorities, in which Durant asked a woman to convince a mutual friend to tell police a robbery had taken place.\n\"That's all I need him to do,\" he wrote in the letter. \"I swear they're going to drop the case.\"\nOn the stand, Durant said he simply wanted her to ask their friend to be honest about what happened, while the prosecution painted the letter as an attempt to pressure the friend to give police a story that would back up Durant's own version of events. The language itself was somewhat ambiguous.\nThe woman said she never followed through. And the friend, who also testified, told the jury there was no robbery.\nChristian Sheppard with one of his daughters. Photo: CourtesyWhen he himself testified, Durant said he felt nervous to be on the stand. He told the jury he was born at Alta Bates and grew up in Berkeley. He went to Malcolm X Elementary, and later attended Berkeley High. He lived in South Berkeley his entire life, he said. He wore a dark blue suit over a white dress shirt and yellow tie throughout the trial, and black-rimmed glasses, too. His wore his long dreadlocks pulled back in a band or, other times, braided together.\nIn a calm, low voice, and without hesitation, he described the day of the dice game, and the robbery he said took place. He said he had just rolled the dice when a man in a mask came up behind him. The man, whose face he never saw, was holding a gun.\n\"He said, 'you niggas don't move, give me everything,'\" Durant said. \"'Tear it off, or I'm gonna shoot.'\"\nDurant said he emptied his pockets on the ground in front of him, but that Sheppard refused to do the same.\n\"I know who you are, I'm not giving you nothing,\" Sheppard said, as Durant recalled it.\nDurant said he tried to reason with his friend, saying, \"Dude, don't argue with this man, he has a gun. All we have is little. We can get it back.\"\nDurant said Sheppard, who had been seated and relaxing against a wall with one shoe off, began to stand up and the robber opened fire. Sheppard collapsed on the ground immediately, Durant said.\nDurant said the shooter then began to turn on him, and he \"jumped up, sprang forward and grabbed his arm\" to keep himself from getting shot. After a tussle, Durant said he was able to run away. After making it around the corner, he said he looked back and was surprised to see no one following him.\nWhat he could see, however, were Christian's shoes. He said he turned around to check on his friend.\n\"As I got to him, I noticed he was shot up everywhere,\" with blood all over his face. \"I called his name and he didn't say nothing. He didn't move.\"\nHe said he thought Sheppard was dead because of all the blood.\nHe then saw what he said was his own cash still on the ground.\n\"I picked my money up and put it in my pocket, and started to run off,\" he told the jury. He ducked through a hole in the fence, looked back one more time, and ran straight home, he told the jury.\n\"I was thinking, hopefully I don't get shot,\" he said. \"Hopefully the person who tried to rob us doesn't appear out of nowhere and try to shoot me again.\"\nLoved ones remember Christian Sheppard. Photo: CourtesyAfter he got home, he said, phone calls were rolling in, as a number of people checked on Durant to see if he was all right. He assured them, briefly, he was fine. Perhaps 45 minutes later, he stepped outside to \"spark the rest of a little blunt to calm my nerves,\" and that's when he was arrested.\nBlessing Hunter, with Christian Sheppard, who was her uncle. The two were raised together and were frequently by each other's sides. Photo: CourtesyDurant admitted he lied in response to a number of questions during his police interview because -- according to his code -- you're not supposed to talk to police, no matter what the reason, and because he had \"nothing to do\" with the homicide.\nHe also said he wasn't surprised that no one had backed up the robbery story, because no one in his circle is comfortable cooperating with police.\nAnd he said his arrest, on suspicion of homicide, came as a total shock.\n\"I really didn't know what was going on,\" he said. \"I knew what happened. I didn't know they was coming for me.\"\nAs he concluded his first set of questions for his client, Arroyo said he was \"just going to ask ... the $64,000 question\": Did you kill him?\n\"No, I did not,\" Durant said. \"I'm very shocked and nervous and scared at the same time. I'm here fighting for my life. I did not kill my friend Christian.\"\nHe continued, later in the proceeding: \"I'm surprised people think I did this to my own friend that I've known basically for half my life.\"\nIn his cross-examination, Wilson said it made no sense that the robber appeared to have taken nothing from the scene, and the only person who had done so seemed to be Durant. Wilson noted that Durant's description of a struggle over the gun -- in which he had gestured in court that the weapon had been pointed up into the air -- did not align with the evidence and casings at the scene, or the injuries in Sheppard's body.\nChristian Sheppard, remembered by loved ones as \"Berkeley's finest\" on a memorial shirt.

Durant said he had not.\n\"Isn't that basic human dignity?\" Wilson asked.\n\"I had no way to get in contact,\" Durant replied, of the family he had known for half his life.\nWilson also asked Durant whether he tried to call 911 for help -- he had not -- and about the bloodstained money police found in his pocket.\n\"Instead of checking on him, you picked up the money. He's laying there. The money is in his blood,\" Wilson said, stopping.\n\"It was my money,\" Durant told him.\n", "Coder Initials": "LN", "Title": "Jury finds Berkeley man guilty of murder of childhood friend after dice game", "Tags": "['1600 block of Russell Street', '2015 homicide', \"Alameda County district attorney's office\", 'Anthony Durant', 'Berkeley crime', 'Berkeley Police', 'Christian Sheppard', 'Guns in Berkeley', 'Homicide in Berkeley', 'Public safety', 'Shootings in Berkeley', 'South Berkeley']", "Sections": "['Crime', 'Crime', 'Crime & Safety']", "Natural Language Location": "1611 Russell Street", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8556107", "Zip Code": "94703", "ID": "246087", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2766084", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/10/jury-finds-berkeley-man-guilty-murder-childhood-friend-dice-game/", "Author": "Emilie Raguso", "Date": "2017-02-10T16:49:12-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Willard Middle School at 2425 Stuart St. Photo: Nancy RubinSee update below.\nWillard Middle School was put on lockdown Friday afternoon, due to police activity in the area.\nIn a phone message alert sent out to the school community at 1:17 p.m., Principal Debbie Dean said that the lockdown had just been lifted and had lasted about 15 minutes.

Photo: Truitt & WhiteThe cyclist who died Wednesday morning after a car crash in North Berkeley has been identified by community members and co-workers as Joseph Hurlimann.\n\"Many people might remember him riding through the University Ave., Curtis Street area of Berkeley near the car wash at times picking up recycling material and loading it onto his little old bike,\" Matt Calkins, a good friend of Hurlimann's longtime next door neighbor, told Berkeleyside. \"He did not own a car.\"\nScroll down to see a poem written by a neighbor in memory of Joe HurlimannHurlimann \"had been riding his bike around Berkeley since he was a child.\" He grew up near University Avenue and Curtis and still lived in his childhood home.\nAs of Thursday afternoon, the Alameda County coroner's office has not released Hurlimann's name because no relatives have been found. But numerous people who have known Hurlimann for decades have said he had no immediate family left, and no close relatives they knew of.\n\nHurlimann, who was 78, had a basket attached to the back of his old single-speed bike, which was gray. Sometimes, he would stack wood scraps tied with twine -- from his longtime employer Truitt & White -- 4 to 5 feet high on the basket. He would take the scraps home to his workshop, turn them into stakes, and sell them back to Truitt & White, which is located just west of the railroad tracks and south of Hearst Avenue.\n\"It always looked like he couldn't possibly make it across the railroad tracks without the whole stack collapsing. But he always did,\" recalled Dan White, Truitt & White's CEO. \"I'm sure lots and lots of people have seen him around town over the years.\"\nWhite said Wednesday it had been a very sad day for everyone at the company.\n\"I've known Joe my whole life,\" he said.\nHurlimann was Truitt & White's longest running employee, with more than 60 years with the business. He began working for the family-owned building materials company in the 1950s, when he was still in high school.\nJoe Hurlimann's senior class photo. Photo: Saint Mary's College High SchoolHurlimann worked part time until he graduated from Saint Mary's College High School in 1956. He went on to attend UC Berkeley, where he got a PhD in plant pathology as part of the first class of the College of Natural Resources, according to its alumni magazine.\nWhite said Hurlimann continued as a researcher at Cal for a long time, though he retired from UC Berkeley about two decades back.\nAccording to online records, Hurlimann retired from Cal in 1991 after working there for 31 years. He drew a small pension from the university. He's listed as a coauthor on nearly 100 academic articles and reports in the area of plant biology, according to Google Scholar.\nUC Berkeley spokeswoman Gretchen Kell said Hurlimann actually got three degrees from Cal: his bachelor's in soil science in 1961, a master's in plant pathology in 1964, and his doctorate in plant pathology in 1974.\nEven while at UC Berkeley, however, Hurlimann worked at Truitt & White on weekends and vacations.\n\"He liked us and we liked him,\" White said. \"It was always a kick to have him around.\"\nWhite said one reason for the longtime connection was that Hurlimann had a close bond with White's father, one of Truitt & White's founders. (The Truitt family, which was the other founder, is no longer part of the company, but Dan White and his brother Warren now run it, and each has a son who is involved with the business.)\nWhite's father encouraged the young Hurlimann to go to Cal, and mentored him over the years.\n\"They always had this relationship,\" White recalled. He said Hurlimann would stop by the White home from time to time to help with tasks that needed doing. \"He was very handy.\"\nHurlimann never moved out of the small house he grew up in, on Curtis Street, above Allston Way. He lived with his parents until they died, first his father and later his mother. He never married. At the time of his death, he lived alone, and rode his bike everywhere.\nTruitt & White customer Peter Smalley composed this montage, writing, \"Each new delivery brought a surprised chuckle and a moment of close inspection of the artwork. I never knew how these colorful treats were able to survive the near extinction of hand-sent letters, but I liked them, and because I had an unused drawer in my desk, I saved them.\"Hurlimann was known at Truitt & White as an avid stamp collector. White explained that stamp collectors buy sheets of 100, but are mainly interested in the four corner stamps. That left 96 stamps for Hurlimann to share. He would lick them and put them on Truitt & White's envelopes, and sell them back to the company as postage.\nWhite described those envelopes with their vintage stamps as \"one of our claims to fame.\"\nIn June 2016, Truitt & White featured Hurlimann on its Facebook page, writing, \"Joe started his Stamp collection when he was 7 years old and is still collecting stamps today. About 40 years ago he decided he would use his collection on Truitt and White envelopes.\"\nJoe Hurlimann holding an envelope featuring vintage stamps and wearing a Truitt & White pullover. Photo: Truitt & WhiteQuoting Hurlimann, the post continues: \"I've used stamps from the 1930 World's Fair.\" Pictured with him \"are stamps from 30 years ago!\"\nAccording to the short Facebook feature, Hurlimann's first day of work with Truitt & White was Oct. 19, 1955. (The company was founded in 1946.) His first job was stocking shelves.\nMore recently, his jobs with the company included organizing its postage and counting inventory.\n\"When I started in 1955, Truitt and White was just a contractor shed and the lumber was stocked in the barn,\" he said, according to the Facebook post, which continued, \"Joe has a great sense of humor, when asked what he does today he laughs and says, 'I count sticks.'\"\nWhite said Hurlimann, who worked part time, kept a close eye on the company inventory. Materials get cut to different lengths, for example, and keeping track can be quite a project. The company sells materials such as lumber, doors, windows, paint, tools, siding and more.\n\"He would go around the yard with his clipboard and count stuff,\" White said. \"He would go around with his tally sheet and count everything.\"\nWhite said Hurlimann's long tenure with the company was quite a feat. He recalled how it had once come up at a going-away event for another longtime employee.\n\"I called on Joe and said, 'What do you think about the new guy quitting already?'\" White laughed, recalling the moment: The \"new guy,\" he added, \"had been there for 30 years!\"\nWhite said Hurlimann had a unique personality. He didn't question authority, exactly, but had a healthy sense of skepticism.\n\"He'd always grumble in recent years about the doctors, saying, 'I don't think that guy knew what he was talking about,'\" White said.\nThe company got a call from Hurlimann's neighbor on Wednesday to let them know about his death. The news hit the company hard.\n\"He's been there forever,\" said White. \"It's sad to see him go.\"\nAdded Patty White, Dan's wife: \"We all knew and loved Joe.\" She said, in addition to his stamp collecting, he also loved to garden.\nHurlimann attended mass at St. Joseph the Worker Church, at 1640 Addison St. As a child, he had attended its Catholic grammar school. His family were lifelong parishioners at the church, and Hurlimann's funeral is likely to take place there.\n\"I remember that, for years, Joe brought the dozens of poinsettias and Easter lilies that decorated St. Joseph's Church for the holidays,\" said Jeanne Loughman of Saint Mary's College High School in North Berkeley. He grew all the flowers up at his Cal greenhouse while he worked there.\nMilton Schroth, UC Berkeley professor emeritus of plant pathology, described Hurlimann as hardworking and dedicated.\n\"One of the most important things of any profession is to know what your own skills are, and he felt he'd be the type of person who could help others,\" Schroth said. \"He did all kinds of practical things for us in the department, carpentry and other things\"\nSeveral people with Truitt & White ties shared reflections of Hurlimann with Berkeleyside on Wednesday.\nEddy Tenret said Hurlimann had been very active in his church, and was the only child of German immigrants. Tenret said he believed Hurlimann's dad, too, at one time did some work for Truitt & White when Hurlimann was a boy.\n\"Easiest going guy, with a big heart and soul. One of the strongest men I knew. Sad to see this. He was a Berkeley native his whole life,\" wrote Matt DuPont, who worked with Hurlimann for 18 years.\nAnother co-worker, Christian Vazquez, said he \"joked around with him on many occasions, he was extremely sharp for his age. He was a very humble guy.\"\nDan White said the company would likely make time for employees to come together to remember Hurlimann, and is still seeking the official word about the fatality from authorities.\n\"I will want to pursue it,\" he said, adding: \"If there's no family, I don't know what happens next.\"\nA representative from the coroner's office said, if next of kin cannot be located, the case could eventually be identified as \"county indigent,\" but she said she had never heard of that happening.\nMinimal information has been available about the circumstances of Wednesday's crash, but Hurlimann was not wearing a helmet, according to one of the first people to reach the crash scene, at Sacramento Street south of Hopkins. The police report is not complete, so the primary collision factor has not been identified, authorities said Thursday.\nMatt Calkins -- the good friend of Hurlimann's neighbor -- described him as \"a very sweet, soft-spoken, and humble old man.\"\nHe continued: \"I was always intrigued by him, by his story, and by his daily work ethic and simple way of life. Berkeley has lost one of its sweetest old characters.\"\nUpdate, Feb. 10, 3 p.m. A resident of the Ada Street neighborhood wrote this poem for Joe, and shared it with Berkeleyside.\n\"My Neighborhood Landscape\"\nIn Memory of the Man Who Died on Sacramento Street Feb. 8, 2017\n \nI knew you.\nDid you know me?\nYou were part of my neighborhood, the taken for granted, landscape.\nYou biked of necessity,\nYou biked of purpose.\nAn old small girl's bike, no bells or whistles.\nOf necessity, a basket for the oranges\nAnd vegetables you were welcomed to\nAt the produce market around the corner\nBefore opening hours\nBefore the crowds.\nI tried to catch your eye, to say 'hello', or was that in my imagination?\nNo matter,\nWe never did make eye contact.\nBut I knew you,\nYou bicycled down my street nearly every morning.\nYou were older than most who pedal.\nShort of stature, the girl's bike a little too small for you,\n those wide handlebars...\nYou were handsome,\n grey white hair, button down, always  clean looking shirt, weathered jacket...\na handsome man on an almost too small bike.\nYou were dignified, gentle and kind...I just knew.\nThe man who stood over your broken body trying to breathe you back to life, knew, too.\n'He seemed sweet', he said.\nYou looked relaxed, confident in the early morning air.\n Now you are gone...\nMangled bike, body under a white tent, bright yellow tape blocking streets - gone.\nAnd in the absence of you,\nI recognize how much of you I really did know and see\nand take for granted\nin my neighborhood landscape.\n \n-Joan Alexander, Feb. 9, 2017\nEditor's note: Comments from UC Berkeley were added at 4 p.m. Feb. 9. On Feb. 10, additional information about Hurlimann's early life, including his grade school and high school, as well as a high school yearbook photograph and church, were added to the story after this information was provided by Saint Mary's College High School.\nFuneral mass for Joseph Hurlimann: A funeral mass will be offered at St. Joseph the Worker Church for its longtime parishioner Joseph Hurlimann on Thursday, March 9 at 10:30 a.m. There will be a short viewing of the body at 10 a.m. prior to Mass. Afterwards there will be a gravesite committal service at St. Joseph Cemetery in San Pablo. All friends and parishioners of \"Joe\" are welcome to join.

I stopped my car in the middle of the ... lanes on Sacramento to try to prevent any more cars from coming through. The victim was prone and both legs looked badly broken. He wasn't breathing and didn't have a pulse. I turned him over to get his airway open, started chest compressions, I didn't do any rescue breaths because there was just too much blood and I didn't have a mask. There wasn't much I could do. Between sets of compressions I kept checking for a pulse, trying to talk to him, rubbing his sternum to see if I could get any response.

Photo: Allen RabinovichAuthorities have just confirmed that the deaths of a young couple and their cats in their Berkeley apartment nearly two weeks ago was the result of \"acute carbon monoxide intoxication.\"\nThe Berkeley Police Department has described the case as a \"tragic accident.\"\nRoger Hanna Morash, 35, and Valerie Morash 32, were found dead Jan. 23 in their apartment at 3028 Deakin St. Their two Singapura cats, Minsky and Malloc, were also dead.\nPolice have not identified the source of the carbon monoxide, and say further testing will need to be done.\n\nBPD said in a prepared statement Friday that it \"took some time to determine the cause - autopsy findings, toxicology reports, necropsy, and other tests - however; our goal was to provide the family of the decedents with the most accurate answers regarding the death of their loved ones.\"\nPolice investigators collected \"various items within the apartment to test for toxins\" but none were found by the state's Public Health Department.\nPolice said the bodies of the couple's cats also were examined, through necropsies, and the cats were also found to have died from carbon monoxide poisoning.\nPolice said Friday detectives are \"still trying to identify the specific source of the carbon monoxide.\"\nFirst responders are in the 3000 block of Deakin Street but details are slim. Photo: Sean RouseIn the past week, investigators reached out to the property's landlord \"to coordinate tests and inspections\" in the couple's apartment, and attempted to arrange for the building, which has four units, to be vacant at the time of their work.\n\"Investigators did not order anyone to evacuate their apartments. The proposed tests have been cancelled while the Department works through the residents' concerns,\" police said. \"Investigators are focused on trying to determine the source of the carbon monoxide in order to provide peace of mind to the families and residents of the building.\"\nABC 7 reported Thursday at 11 p.m. that residents had been ordered to evacuate the building, but BPD said the tests had already been called off at the time that report went live.\nBPD Lt. Dan Montgomery said there are several appliances to test and rule out, and more than one theory about the source of the carbon monoxide. But he said he could not specify further due to the ongoing investigation.\n\"The purpose of the tests is to give everybody peace of mind and find out,\" he said Friday.\nThere has been some confusion about the role carbon monoxide may have played in the couple's deaths because police initially said the BFD hazmat team and PG&E were called to the scene to measure for unsafe levels of gas or other problems, but found none.\nPG&E spokeswoman Tamar Sarkissian said earlier this week that \"PG&E participated in the initial investigation and it was determined that this was not a gas-related event.\"\nSarkissian also said she could not confirm that the building was heated by gas, due to privacy laws, and could not say whether there had been a history of complaints or calls to the property related to carbon monoxide. She said the building owner or Berkeley Fire Department might have further information.\nBut medical tests ultimately showed toxic levels of the gas to be the cause of death, police said Friday. The discrepancy could be related to the fact that the couple's bodies likely were found more than 24 hours after they died, and carbon monoxide levels in the apartment could have changed by the time first responders got to the scene.\nIn its statement, BPD said it \"extends our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Roger and Valerie Morash.\"\nThe department thanked the Alameda County coroner's office, the state Public Health Department's Microbial Diseases and Pathogen Section, PG&E, Berkeley City Animal Care Services, and the Berkeley Fire Department \"for their help in the investigation.\"\nStay tuned to Berkeleyside for continuing coverage.\n", "Coder Initials": "LN", "Title": "Berkeley Police: Carbon monoxide caused deaths of couple and their cats", "Tags": "['Berkeley fatality', 'Berkeley Police', 'Public safety']", "Sections": "['Crime & Safety', 'Crime & Safety', 'Police']", "Natural Language Location": "3028 Deakin Street", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.854558", "Zip Code": "94705", "ID": "247228", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.262525", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/02/03/berkeley-police-carbon-monoxide-caused-death-couple-cats/", "Author": "Emilie Raguso", "Date": "2017-02-03T17:43:30-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "A man who was being followed by UC police ran a red light on College and Ashby, crashed into some cars, and fled, leaving his car to crash into Dream Fluff Donuts.

At times, they are primarily observers, but Kusmiss said, if they feel confident, the supervising officer can give the green light for more authority.\nKusmiss said perhaps one in six officers don't make it past this part of the process, which follows the police academy for new recruits. There are currently nine officers in training at BPD, which has about 34 trainers. Another four new trainees are set to begin in March.\nWhile other departments have higher-stress programs, Kusmiss described Berkeley's field training program as \"really predicated on fostering the officer-in-training's success.\" That's not to say there isn't stress, however.\n\"They are being evaluated every single day, all day,\" she said.\n", "Coder Initials": "LN", "Title": "Berkeley car stop nets nearly 60 stolen cards, handgun; 2 men arrested", "Tags": "['Berkeley crime', 'Berkeley Police', 'Public safety', 'Sgt.

Photo: Emilie RagusoNearly two dozen Berkeley police officers were recognized Thursday night for exceptional service, lifesaving efforts, community efforts and more in the second annual Berkeley Police Association dinner at Fieldwork Brewery in West Berkeley.\nThe awards go back decades in Berkeley though they haven't always been a regular event, and the format of the ceremony has varied.\nHonorees were recognized across eight areas for outstanding work related to a variety of patrol and investigative achievements, and other service to the community. Officer Andres Bejarano, who will be moving into the BPD homicide detail in March, received the top honor of \"Officer of the Year.\"\n\"I know the self-sacrifice that you make every day, and I know the commitment you make to make this city a wonderful place,\" City Manager Dee Williams-Ridley told the 100 or so attendees at the celebration. \"Because of you, it is simply a better place to live.\"\n\nWilliams-Ridley said she and many others in Berkeley have been inspired by the Berkeley Police Department.\n\"Thousands of people here in Berkeley look up to each of you and often need you in more critical ways than even your family members. That is both a ... burden and an honor,\" she said.\nInterim Berkeley Police Chief Andrew Greenwood told those who had gathered that he appreciated being able to celebrate the department's successes with current employees, their families, and retirees alike. He thanked staff for being proactive and \"for taking action without being asked, without thinking twice.\"\n\"Your good work matters,\" he said. \"In doing that good work, you make us a great organization.\"\nFour officers -- Peter Hong, Tim Kaplan, Rochell Bledsoe and Dave White -- received service and fidelity awards for being at BPD for at least 20 years. Sgt. Emily Murphy, BPA vice president, stands with them. Photo: Ryan MontgomeryFour officers -- Rochell Bledsoe, Tim Kaplan, Peter Hong and Dave White -- received service and fidelity awards for being at BPD for at least 20 years.\nOfficer Jeremy Lathrop and Detective Peter Lee received commendations for each having completed a \"particularly noteworthy achievement.\"\nSgt. Samantha Speelman said Lathrop was instrumental in a \"painstaking investigation\" that resulted in one of the largest seizures of powder cocaine in department history -- more than 2 kilos of cocaine -- along with evidence of drug sales, multiple firearms and more. Lathrop obtained confessions that led to four arrests. One of the arrests was a person with a history of violence, including an arrest for murder, Speelman said.\nLee was involved in an investigation into a robbery series tied to 23 robberies in Berkeley, Albany, Oakland, Hayward, San Leandro and San Francisco in February 2016. Speelman said Lee realized how numerous Berkeley robberies fit in, became lead investigator on the cases and developed a regional task force. He pushed for stakeouts at places that might be targeted, and surveillance led to the detention of several armed suspects. Three people were ultimately taken off the streets as a result.\n\"Even though evidence was lacking,\" she said, \"he never gave up the fight.\"\nOfficer Lionell Dozier was recognized for community service due to off-duty efforts with the Berkeley Young Adult Project (YAP), which focuses on tutoring, violence prevention and leadership development. He started at YAP in 2001 as a speaker in the Twilite Basketball program, then continued on, helping with homework, mentoring, coaching basketball and assisting on special events and field trips. Dozier also coaches football at Berkeley High.\n\"Officer Dozier is a wonderful example of a police officer who works alongside -- and within -- the community he serves,\" said Officer Jennifer Coats.\nBPD came together with friends and family to recognize department successes Thursday. Photo: Emilie RagusoSix officers got \"Exceptional Service\" awards: Daniel Breaux, Donovan Edwards, Devin Hogan, Megan Jones, Melissa Kelly and Matt McGee. Breaux was described as \"one of the leading crime fighters in the department.\" Edwards and Jones had a record number of arrests from 2016. All three have been proactive in terms of DUI enforcement.\nOfficers Hogan and Jones, and Officer Scott Castle. Photo: Ryan MontgomeryHogan was recognized for regular vehicle stops where he has recovered drugs, along with at least eight loaded handguns or pistols, and an assault rifle with a loaded 40-round magazine that had been hidden in a guitar case.\nLast year, Kelly got a lead in a \"notorious serial sexual assault investigation that shook the Berkeley community\" in 2008. After a six-hour interrogation, she had enough evidence for the suspect to be charged; he is now awaiting trial and could face life in prison. In another case, a Cal student was sexually assaulted on a footpath near campus. The victim was beaten and robbed, in addition to the sexual assault. After working the case, the suspect was charged with multiple felonies. There were also two major child abuse cases she worked that led to charges by the Alameda County district attorney's office.\nDetective Matt McGee was chosen due to his work as the Berkeley High school resource officer and his help there putting together a course to give students an inside look at police work and the criminal justice system. Students who met McGee in that course have said interactions with him helped them \"see police officers as people with families, hobbies, and dreams.\" McGee is also the juvenile detective in BPD's Special Victims Unit: \"His duties are often complex and include sexual assaults, domestic violence, and child abuse cases.\"\nOfficer Jennifer Coats, former department spokeswoman, received a meritorious service award. In recent years, she has represented BPD at as many police officer funerals as she can, and written personal letters to departments where officers have died. It all began in 2009, when she attended the funeral for four fallen OPD officers and, since then, she has gone to nearly every officer funeral in Northern California. She's also volunteered off duty to coordinate the department's participation in the Northern California Special Olympics.\nBerkeley Police Chief Andrew Greenwood at the BPA awards dinner. Photo: Emilie RagusoFive officers received awards for helping save lives.\nLast February, Neil Egbert was flagged down near Euclid and Hearst for a man in the street who was unconscious. A doctor was tending to the man, who had a heart attack while jogging. Egbert gave the doctor a CPR mask, and took over chest compressions until paramedics arrived and got the man to the hospital.\nThe next month, Jessyca Nabozny responded to a scene with a gunshot victim at 10th and Delaware streets He was having trouble breathing and going in and out of consciousness: \"Officer Nabozny identified a potentially fatal sucking chest wound and was able to successfully seal the wound with her gloved hand.\"\nIn July, officers responded to the 2100 block of Fifth Street when a 4-month-old baby stopped breathing. Officer Kenneth Tu had to hop a fence to get inside because no one would answer the door. He quickly began infant CPR and got a faint pulse, and Officer Chris Flores, a trained EMT, took over when he arrived. Both received lifesaving awards. Two other officers -- Matthew Valle and Jaylon Debruin -- received commendations for their coordination of resources on scene.\nIn September, Casimiro Pierantoni went to a family fight at a home on Prince Street. A man inside in mental health crisis had a knife and was threatening to kill himself as well as responding officers. Over the course of three hours, Pierantoni worked to develop a rapport with the man who several times tried to throw glass bottles at him. Ultimately, he convinced the man to come outside, resolving the standoff.\nSgt. Emily Murphy explains why Officer Andres Bejarano was selected as the 2016 \"Officer of the Year.\" Photo: Emilie RagusoThe final award of the night went to \"Officer of the year\" Bejarano, sometimes called \"Beej,\" who has been at BPD for just five years. He was chosen for his \"strong work ethic, exceptional casework and his dedication to duty.\" He grew up in Chico and got a bachelor's in construction management from Chico State. He was a high school football coach during college, then helped build a terminal at Sacramento Airport before getting hired at BPD.\nHe's served on the department's Drug Task Force and Special Response Team, and is a field training officer, helping to guide and oversee new hires. Come March, he'll be the department's newest homicide detective. And, last year, he received a \"Hero Award\" from Mothers Against Drunk Driving for initiating the most DUI arrests at BPD.\nOfficer Bejarano. Photo: Ryan MontgomeryBejarano made more than 50 arrests last year, and often has one of the highest records for arrests each month.\n\"Many of these arrests involved substantial amounts of investigation and his efforts have translated to successfully prosecuted cases and a valued reputation at the district attorney's office,\" said Sgt. Emily Murphy in her remarks about the award. In one of those cases, a search of individuals in a parked vehicle led to the recovery of stolen property from four auto burglary victims. Bejarano was able to get a confession from the suspect.\nIn another, he helped track down and arrest a man suspected of convincing minors to give him lewd photographs. After the arrest, Bejarano found photographs of the victims on the man's cellphone, and later got a full confession.\nThere was also a case where, during a car stop, he recovered three loaded firearms \"concealed in secret compartments throughout the vehicle,\" then got confessions from all three of the vehicle's occupants related to the guns. All three were charged and entered no contest pleas in connection with the case.\nIn his \"thank you\" speech, Bejarano described the job as a \"great adventure.\"\n\"This award here says 'officer of the year'.... but there are numerous men and women who are deserving of this,\" he said. \"I've just been lucky enough not only to have met great people here, but great cops.... cops who wanted to make a difference and work hard.\"\n", "Coder Initials": "LN", "Title": "Police recognize standout officers at awards dinner", "Tags": "['Berkeley Police', 'Berkeley Police Association']", "Sections": "['Crime & Safety', 'Crime & Safety', 'Police']", "Natural Language Location": "Berkeley Police Department", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.870184", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "246255", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.273261", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/01/30/berkeley-police-recognize-standout-officers-at-awards-dinner/", "Author": "Emilie Raguso", "Date": "2017-01-30T13:00:03-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Aneka Patterson, sister of slain Berkeley rap musician Alex Goodwin Jr. -- who went by the name \"AyeGee\" -- was one of many speakers Sunday who asked police to help get justice for Goodwin.

A Berkeleyside story on the overall event is forthcoming.\nGoodwin was 22 when he was fatally shot after he walked outside the family home at Mabel and Burnett streets just south of San Pablo Park, where Sunday's meeting was held. He attended Berkeley Arts Magnet, King Middle School and Berkeley High.\n\nA woman called police around the time of the gunshots to report that her brother had left their home but never came back inside. That woman was Aneka Patterson.\n\"I know some people who are tired of being shot at, tired of being harassed by these other people and are willing to talk to you guys,\" Patterson told police Sunday. \"I'm pretty sure you guys know the people who are basically terrorizing South Berkeley and it seems like it's just nothing being done.\"\nMeeting attendees held signs asking for \"Justice for AyeGee.\" Photo: Emilie RagusoPatterson indicated that there was little mystery as to who was responsible for her brother's death. And she urged police to try harder to build relationships with the community, and to reassure people who might share information that steps would be taken for their safety.\n\"A lot of young people don't trust you guys,\" she said. \"I'm trying to get into the head of a lot of them because I do know a lot of them.\"\nGoodwin's mother, Kameka Goodwin, said she wants to be in regular contact with police so she can be sure to know what's going on with the investigation. She also brought up the $15,000 reward police have offered in connection with the case. (Details appear at the bottom of this story.) She said she hopes officers could go door to door to spread the word about the reward, which she fears may not have been promoted enough.\nGoodwin's grandmother, Sarah Patterson, described the mural she had painted on the front of her home two months back in honor of her grandson. The mural shows her grandson's face in the clouds. He's wearing a Cal hat and the message #LongLive Aye-Gee appears beside him.\nPatterson said candles burn daily for her grandson, and that friends often come by to bring flowers and other memorial items.\n\"We're going to let these people know that his name will go on. And, when they do come by, I just hope they look and see him,\" she told the crowd. \"And I hope it just drives them to come to the Berkeley police office and say: 'I did it.'\"\nA mural on his family's home honors slain rap artist Alex Goodwin Jr. Photo: Emilie RagusoShe said she would not let the tragedy, or fear of more violence, drive her family from their longtime home.\n\"We're not going to be afraid because I think that's what they want us to be,\" she said. \"Some people say, 'Are you going to still stay there, after your grandson was killed?'

He helped his grandmother.... and he did not deserve what happened to him.\"\nBerkeley Police Chief Andrew Greenwood promised Goodwin's family he would sit down with them in private to discuss the case.\nHe said officers continue to take the investigation seriously and that, speaking hypothetically, even if they believed they knew the identity of the shooter, they would not make any arrests without enough evidence to bring charges.\nAnd he said information from friends and family often plays a crucial role in making headway. But it's not always forthcoming, which can be a frustration.\nGreenwood said homicide detectives work long hours and follow every lead to try to find the person responsible for the crimes they investigate and bring that person to justice.\n\"Our department has not, nor will it, make arrests in a haphazard fashion,\" Greenwood said. \"When we make an arrest in a homicide, it is going to be when we think we have that person to rights.\"\nThe city of Berkeley is offering a $15,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone responsible for the death of Alex Goodwin Jr. Detectives have asked for the community's help with the investigation.

Berkeley even expanded hours for warming centers, places people can stay during the day, but the extra daytime hours have not been well-used and are being phased out, according to a staff report.\nStill, many people who live outdoors avoid the shelters. They regard the city-run facilities as restrictive and prefer their independence and the camaraderie of the communities they have built up around them, according to homeless providers and interviews with those who are homeless.\nWhite and Belser, who is the executive director of the Ed Roberts Campus, are planning to move a brown-shingle duplex now on Walnut Street to the property on Martin Luther King Jr. Way and restore it as affordable housing. Equity Residential purchased the duplex, and another six-unit building when it assembled a number of parcels of land to construct the Acheson Commons project. The buildings were rent-controlled and Equity was required to find a new location for them. Equity sold its stake in the project to Mill Creek Residental, a Texas-based firm, in September. No date has been set yet for the move, said Belser. He and White are still looking for a parcel on which to place the larger home.\nThe two men have not seen campers on the MLK property before, said Belser. Some police officers said they knew the deceased woman and had interacted with her before, he said.\nEditors' note: This article was updated to include comments by the Berkeley Police Department and to remove a reference to death by \"natural causes.\"\n", "Coder Initials": "LN", "Title": "Body of homeless woman found near Berkeley High", "Tags": "['Berkeley fatality', 'Berkeley homelessness', 'Public safety']", "Sections": "['Crime & Safety', 'Crime & Safety', 'Police']", "Natural Language Location": "2214 Martin Luther King Jr. Way", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8681103", "Zip Code": "94704", "ID": "244653", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2728446", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/01/15/body-homeless-woman-found-near-berkeley-high/", "Author": "Frances Dinkelspiel", "Date": "2017-01-15T12:36:36-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Gunshots fired at Russell and Acton streets this morning damaged this car and some surrounding property.

Photo: Emilie Raguso\nThere has been a lot of discussion in the past year over people using gender-neutral pronouns, specifically the use of \"they/them\" instead of \"he\" and \"she.\"\nThis may be because the use of they/them is becoming more common and widespread, or because people like to find new, relatively mundane things to make controversial. Reactionaries everywhere have griped that \"they\" and \"them\" are plural pronouns, and it's breaking traditional rules of grammar to use them to refer to a singular person.\nLanguage has never been an objective or static truth, but rather is constantly being created and recreated to meet the needs of people. This pedantic interest in words is masking something much more sinister: a basic discomfort with people who are different, and a fear of the undermining of the traditional gender roles that have long structured certain people's sense of the world and of themselves.\nSo, surprising to no one, there has been considerable right-wing media outrage over Berkeleyside's decision to use the preferred gender pronouns of Pablo Gomez Jr., 22, the main suspect in the killing of Emilie Inman, 27, on Jan. 6 in a home in the 2400 block of Ashby Avenue and the stabbing of another woman. Berkeleyside, based on police reports, first referred to Gomez as \"he.\" But after learning that Gomez prefers \"they/them\" pronouns, Berkeleyside corrected its initial identification and started to refer to Gomez as \"they.\" Berkeleyside then continued on with the normal reporting of the homicide, which was totally unrelated to Gomez's gender identity.\nThis correction was picked up by the likes of Ann Coulter, a right-wing commentator, and has prompted the absurd but unfortunately expected question: \"Should murderers get to choose their gender pronouns?\" Many people responding to Coulter's tweets said Gomez should not. The idea behind this line of questioning is that the right to decide your own gender is a privilege that one should earn. That argument would hold more weight if it had ever been applied to murderers with traditional gender pronouns. (Like: Why shouldn't we call this man \"she\" because he murdered someone?)\nSo what's really being expressed by this sentiment is that gender queer or gender non-conforming individuals deserve less respect than cis (gender-conforming) people. Not to mention the fact that Gomez being an alleged killer is just a convenience to Ann Coulter's bigoted agenda, which probably wouldn't allow Mother Teresa the right to gender-neutral pronouns.\nThe they/them backlash is just the latest manifestation of the general discomfort with the knowledge that gender is not a natural truth; or in other words, that our genital and chromosomal makeups don't necessarily decide our personalities, presentations, behaviors, sexual preferences or social roles. And, for those of us whose gender presentations and preferences don't cohere to our assigned genders, \"they/them\" offers an alternative that feels good. For other people, \"they/them\" may feel more comfortable because it offers an opportunity to define your gender on your own terms, outside of traditional social norms. And other people may not like it, for whatever reason, and that's also their prerogative.\nWhile some may use this tragedy as an opportunity to mobilize queerphobia, I would insist that one can mourn the loss of a life without taking away Gomez's right to their gender. Part of understanding and treating gender-queer people as people means accepting that some of us may not be good people, but all people should have the right to gender self-determination.\n", "Coder Initials": "LN", "Title": "Op-ed: Pablo Gomez Jr. is suspected of homicide, but they deserve to be known by the gender pronoun they prefer", "Tags": "['2017 homicide', 'Berkeley Police', 'Emilie Inman', 'Homicide in Berkeley', 'Pablo Gomez Jr.', 'Public safety']", "Sections": "['Crime', 'Crime', 'Opinion']", "Natural Language Location": "2400 Ashby Avenue", "Latitude (decimal form)": "37.8561937", "Zip Code": "94705", "ID": "244217", "Longitude (decimal form)": "-122.2596032", "URL": "http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/01/12/op-ed-although-pablo-gomez-jr-suspected-homicide-deserve-known-gender-pronoun-prefer/", "Author": "Guest contributor", "Date": "2017-01-12T09:00:23-07:00"}, {"Full Text": "Le Roy and Le Conte.

Berkeleyside broke the news.\nOriginal story, Jan. 6, 11:46 p.m. Police are looking for a person described as armed and dangerous who authorities say is responsible for Berkeley's first homicide of 2017.\nAfter a seriously wounded woman flagged someone down for help just north of the UC Berkeley campus shortly before noon Friday, police ultimately located a \"violent crime\" scene and discovered the body of a person they say has not been identified in the 2400 block of Ashby Avenue.\nNo information about the victim has been released.\n\nPolice have identified the wanted person as 24-year-old Pablo Gomez Jr. of North Hollywood. According to Gomez Jr.'s Facebook page, they are a UC Berkeley student who lives in Berkeley. [A friend contacted Berkeleyside after publication to say that Gomez Jr. uses the pronoun \"they.\" This story has been updated.]\nGomez Jr. has been described as Hispanic, is 5 foot 6 inches tall and 110 pounds, and has brown hair and brown eyes. Police ask anyone who sees Gomez Jr. to call 911 immediately.\n\"A witness who saw him earlier in the day reported that he had shaved his head which may have been done in an effort to alter his appearance,\" police said in a statement released late Friday night.\nPolice say Gomez \"was developed as the primary suspect for both the homicide and the stabbing.\"\nPolice say they responded at 11:42 a.m. to the 2600 block of Ridge Road to help a woman there who had been stabbed.\n\"Officers arrived minutes later and found the seriously wounded victim and the person who had called on her behalf,\" according to the statement.\nFirst responders were called to Ridge Road to help a woman who had been stabbed shortly before noon Friday.

It wasn't until much later that the body of an as of yet, unidentified person was discovered.\"\nA Berkeley resident who passed through the area reported seeing a line of police tape across the whole parking area of a building on Ashby, with two or three BPD SUVs parked in front of the yellow tape and parking area. An officer in another BPD SUV was driving eastbound on Ashby.\nEarly Saturday morning, police remained on scene with the entire north side of the block between Florence and Regent streets cordoned off with caution tape. At least five yellow evidence markers could be seen along the sidewalk, and some officers walked in and out of a two-story home wearing booties and face masks. One officer began taking down much of the yellow tape at about 1:30 a.m., as a group of officers walked out of the house.\nAn Alameda County sheriff's office van was also on the scene, along with a Berkeley Police Crime Scene Unit van. A white picket fence surrounded the home's front yard, and signs saying \"Not our president\" and \"We stand with Standing Rock\" were mounted on the front window. Holiday decorations, including a wreath on the front door, white paper snowflakes, and red and green Christmas stockings, still adorned the living room.\nPolice were still on the scene early Saturday morning in the 2400 block of Ashby Avenue after a homicide Friday.

Her vehicle was found before noon at a location searched during the police investigation. She was last seen Friday morning.\nAccording to several hours of unconfirmed scanner recordings reviewed by Berkeleyside, a young woman in her early 20s, who had just been stabbed, flagged down a passer-by for help near Cloyne Court, a UC Berkeley student housing co-op, just after 11:40 a.m. Friday.\nCloyne Court is at 2600 Ridge Road just north of campus.\nThe woman told police the person who stabbed her was still in the Northside neighborhood, and police immediately began searching multiple locations to try to find that individual.\nInvestigators believe this Toyota Corolla is linked to Friday's homicide and stabbing case. The car was abandoned on the corner of Ridge Road and La Loma in Berkeley near where a woman who had been stabbed flagged down a passer-by for help.

Berkeleyside removed the name of that facility as a result and has asked BPD for more information. BPD said it could not share further information about the case.)\nThe actual location of the assault was about 2 miles south of Cloyne Court, in the 2400 block of Ashby Avenue near Florence Street, according to scanner traffic. Police searched that location as well, and recovered evidence related to the crime but did not locate the assailant. The door was wide open when police arrived.\nGomez Jr. has been involved with UC Berkeley's Queer Alliance Resource Center, according to the group's Facebook page, and recently helped organize a chalk protest on campus related to sexual assault, the Daily Californian reported in September.\nGomez Jr. is studying \"Chicanx/Latinx Studies\" according to their Facebook page, and is a senior climate action fellow at Alliance for Climate Education.\nPolice ask anyone with information about Gomez's location to call the Berkeley Police Homicide Detail at 510-981-5741.\nRelated:Woman missing after stabbing that sent 1 to hospital (01.06.17)Update: Young woman stabbed; police search for suspect (01.06.16)\nHave a question about a local public safety incident?

An officer responding to the scene spotted a vehicle matching that description heading south on Sacramento from Cedar, and he followed it.\n\n\"When the suspect vehicle ran a solid red light in the southbound lanes of traffic on Sacramento Street at University Avenue, the Officer activated his lights and sirens in an attempt to stop the suspect vehicle. The suspect vehicle ignored the lights and sirens and turned westbound on Allston Way. A block later it was involved in a minor collision at the entrance to Strawberry Creek Park. When the car came to a stop, five suspects fled from the vehicle,\" police said in a Nixle alert.\nThe officer caught one teenage girl on Allston Way at Bonar Street, and police set up a perimeter in the area. Police said they caught another involved teenager at San Pablo Avenue and Allston when she tried to walk out of the perimeter.\nPolice found stolen property from both victims inside the vehicle, which was later determined to have been stolen out of Oakland, though it had not yet been reported stolen at the time of the robberies.\nPolice found other stolen property in the vehicle that the Oakland Police Department said came from another robbery earlier in the night.\nThe two Oakland girls, ages 15 and 16, were arrested and taken to juvenile hall on suspicion of robbery. No further information was available due to privacy laws protecting minors.\nThree males got away, police said.\nAuthorities ask anyone with information about these cases to call the BPD Robbery Detail at 510-981-5742.\nHave a question about a local public safety incident?
