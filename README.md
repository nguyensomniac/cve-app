# Media Narratives App

Final project for CS194-131/DES INV 190-1: Designing Technology to Counter Violent Extremism.

## Setup

This guide assumes you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) installed. The [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/), while not required, is recommended: you can use npm wherever this guide uses Yarn.

### Backend

Our backend runs on the Python framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Backend code lives in the `cve_webserver` directory.

Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to keep dependencies consistent across the team. In the project root directory, run

```
virtualenv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

to set up a virtual environment and install all existing dependencies.

### Frontend

Our frontend runs on React, using the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) scaffolding. The React app is in the `cve_client` folder.

To install dependencies, switch to the `cve_client` folder, and run:

```
yarn    # this is the equivalent of running npm install
```
